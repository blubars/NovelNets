# Infinite Jest Nets

# done:
- get list of characters
    - via [Tim Ware's index](http://web.archive.org/web/20040830084857/http://members.aol.com/russillosm/ijndx.html)

# Todo:
- chronology
    - this is actually a pain in the ass:
        - we have a text file (obviously)
        - `Elegant Complexity` has this by page # (no other real way to do it)
        - going to go through and write up the first sentence of every section
            - use this as breakpoints
- get a Named Entity Parser up and running
- fix footnotes...
    - eg footnote 322 appears as 322312
- fix page breaks
