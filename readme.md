# Infinite Jest Nets

# Todo:
- get list of characters
    - possibly via [Tim Ware's index](http://web.archive.org/web/20040830084857/http://members.aol.com/russillosm/ijndx.html)
    - possibly via `Elegant Complexity`
- chronology
    - this is actually a pain in the ass:
        - we have a text file (obviously)
        - `Elegant Complexity` has this by page # (no other real way to do it)
        - going to go through and write up the first sentence of every section
            - use this as breakpoints
- find version of book used in `Elegant Complexity`
    - _really_ hope it's mine
- get a Named Entity Parser up and running
