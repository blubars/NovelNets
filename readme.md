# Infinite Jest Nets

# WebWeb Install
Please follow the instructions for installing webweb locally via a git repo:
https://github.com/hneutr/webweb

# Todo:
- find entities by section:
    - run graphify for a given section (1-192)
        - brian: 1-50
        - hunter: 51-100
        - carl: 101-150
- chronology
    - this is actually a pain in the ass:
        - we have a text file (obviously)
        - `Elegant Complexity` has this by page # (no other real way to do it)
        - going to go through and write up the first sentence of every section
            - use this as breakpoints
- get a Named Entity Parser up and running
- fix page breaks
