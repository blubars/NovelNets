Known usually as 'drines — i.e. lightweight speed: Cylert, Tenuate, a Fastin, Preludin, even sometimes Ritalin. It's worth an N.B. that, unlike Jim Troeltsch or the Preludin-happy Bridget Boone, Michael Pemulis (out of maybe some queer sort of blue-collar street-type honor) rarely ingests any 'drines before a match, reserving them for recreation — some people are wired to find heart-pounding eye-wobbling 'drine-stimulation recreational.
