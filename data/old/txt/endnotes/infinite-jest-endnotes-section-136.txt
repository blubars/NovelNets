     The festivity here being due largely to the fact that both he and Gerhardt Schtitt returned from putting on little E.T.A. presentations at various
tennis clubs too late to have been informed about the degenerative Eschaton free-for-all and serious Lord-, Ingersoll-, and Penn-injuries, both
trainer Barry Loach and prorector Rik Dunkel having told Avril, and Schtitt to be told by whichever of Nwangi and deLint first works up the pluck,
and the issue of telling Tavis being as would be S.O.P. left up to Avril, who will -- because Tavis has already lost a certain amount of sleep
preparing emotionally and rhetorically for the impending arrival of putative Moment journalist 'Helen' Steeply, whom he's been convinced to let onto
the grounds by Avril's argument that the Moment office promises the profile's subject and inevitable hype involve only an E.T.A. alumnus (Avril
neglected to tell Tavis she was pretty sure it was Orin) and that a certain amount of soft-news-publicity for E.T.A.-qua-institution couldn't hurt in
either the fundraising- or the recruiting-goodwill department -- who will almost certainly wait and tell Tavis (who's in far too festive a mood to
notice three or four younger kids ominously absent from the supper and gala) in the morning, if the poor man's to have a chance at any real sleep
at all (also giving Avril time to figure out how upperclass heads can roll, as of course they must, given chaos and season-ending injuries under the
direct gaze of designated Big Buddies, without those heads including that of Hal, who -- unlike, thank God, John -- was identified at the scene with
that Pemulis person). Hal can tell just by the dining hall's emotional gestalt that neither Schtitt nor Tavis knows about the Eschaton, but the Moms
is next to impossible to read, and Hal won't know whether she's been told of the debacle until he is able to pry Mario away from Anton (The
Boogerman') Doucette and get the Moms-skinny right from Booboo direct, after the film.
