    It's also where Mario's most derivative of Himself, whose own ONANtiad was more centrally concerned with doomed high-office claymation
romance than with political comment, though the love thing in Incandenza Sr.'s film had concerned not Tine and a QuÃ©becois fatale but an alleged
doomed and unconsummated affair between President J. Gentle and the equally hygiene-and-germ-obsessed wife of Canada's 'Minister of Environ-
ment and Resource-Development Enterprises,' the affair presented as doomed and unconsummated because the Minister hires a malevolent young
Canadian Candida albicans specialist to induce in his wife a severe and more or less permanent yeast infection, driving both wife and Gentle to
ardent-desire-v.-hygienic-neurosis breakdowns during which the wife throws herself across the tracks in front of a QuÃ©becois bullet-train and Gentle
decides to exact his revenge on a macrocartographic scale. The ONANtiad was not Him-self's strongest effort by a long shot, and pretty much
everybody around E.T.A. agrees that Mario's own Reconfiguration-explanation-parody is funnier and more accessible than Himself's, if also a bit
heavier-handed.
