     Ennet House takes its urines over to the methadone clinic, which has all manner of clients who have to submit weekly urines to courts and
programs, and the clinic lets Ennet put its urines gratis in the weekly batch the clinic sends out to an E.M.I.T.-mill clinic all the way out in Natick,
and in return every once in a while Pat gets a call from the trollish little social worker who runs #2 about some client down there who's decided he
wants off the methadone, as well, and Pat will shoot the client way up on the Interview list and give him an interview and usually let the client in --
Calvin T. and Danielle S. had both originally gotten into Ennet House this way, i.e. via #2.
