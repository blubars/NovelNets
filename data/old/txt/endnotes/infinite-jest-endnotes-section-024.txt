       JAMES O. INCANDENZA: A FILMOGRAPHY3
    The following listing is as complete as we are able to make it. Because the twelve years of Incandenza's directorial activity also coincided with
large shifts in film venue -- from public art cinemas, to VCR-capable magnetic recordings, to InterLace TelEntertainment laser dissemination and
reviewable storage disk laser cartridges -- and because Incandenza's output itself comprises industrial, documentary, conceptual, advertorial,
technical, parodic, dramatic noncommercial, nondramatic ('anti-confluential') noncommercial, nondramatic commercial, and dramatic commercial
works, this filmmaker's career presents substantive archival challenges. These challenges are also compounded by the facts that, first, for
conceptual reasons, Incandenza eschewed both L. of C. registration and formal dating until the advent of Subsidized Time, secondly, that his
output increased steadily until during the last years of his life Incandenza often had several works in production at the same time, thirdly, that his
production company was privately owned and underwent at least four different changes of corporate name, and lastly that certain of his high-
conceptual projects' agendas required that they be titled and subjected to critique but never filmed, making their status as film subject to
controversy.
   Accordingly, though the works are here listed in what is considered by archivists to be their
   a. From Comstock, Posner, and Duquette, The Laughing Pathologists: Exemplary Works of the Anticonfluential AprÃ¨s Garde: Some Analyses of
the Movement Toward Stasis in North American Conceptual Film (w/ Beth B., Vivienne Dick, James O. Incandenza, Vigdis Simpson, E. and K.
Snow).' ONANite Film and Cartridge Studies Annual, vol. 8, nos. 1-3 (Year of D.P. from the A.H.), pp. 44-117.
   probable order of completion, we wish to say that the list's order and completeness are, at this point in time, not definitive.
   Each work's title is followed: by either its year of completion, or by 'B.S.,' designating undated completion before Subsidization; by the
production company; by the major players, if credited; by the storage medium's ('film' 's) gauge or gauges; by the length of the work to the
nearest minute; by an indication of whether the work is in black and white or color or both; by an indication of whether the film is silent or in sound
or both; by (if possible) a brief synopsis or critical overview; and by an indication of whether the work is mediated by celluloid film, magnetic video,
Interlace Spontaneous Dissemination, TP-compatible InterLace cartridge, or privately distributed by Incandenza's own company(ies). The
designation UNRELEASED is used for those works which never saw distribution and are now publicly unavailable or lost.

Richardson-Levy-O'Byrne-Chawaf, Ken N. Johnson, Dianne Saltoone; Super-8 mm.; 88 minutes; black and white; silent/ sound. Fictional 'interactive
documentary' on Boston stage production of Weiss's 20th-century play within play, in which the documentary's chemically impaired director
(Incandenza) repeatedly interrupts the inmates' dumbshow-capering and Marat and Sade's dialogues to discourse incoherently on the implications
of Brando's Method Acting and Artaud's Theatre of Cruelty for North American filmed entertainment, irritating the actor who plays Marat (Leith) to
such an extent that he has a cerebral hemorrhage and collapses onstage well before Marat's scripted death, whereupon the play's nearsighted
director (Ogilvie), mistaking the actor who plays Sade (Johnson) for Incandenza, throws Sade into Marat's medicinal bath and throttles him to
death, whereupon the extra-dramatic figure of Death ('Psychosis') descends deus ex machina to bear Marat (Leith) and Sade (Johnson) away, while
Incandenza becomes ill all over the theater audience's first row. 8 MM. SYNC-PROJECTION CELLULOID. UNRELEASED DUE TO LITIGATION,

   Infinite Jest (VÃ¯). Year of the Trial-Size Dove Bar. Poor Yorick Entertainment Unlimited. 'Madame Psychosis'; no other definitive data. Thorny
problem for archivists. Incandenza's last film, Incandenza's death occurring during its post-production. Most archival authorities list as unfinished,
unseen. Some list as completion of Infinite Jest (IV), for which Incandenza also used 'Psychosis,' thus list the film under Incandenza's output for
Y.T.M.P. Though no scholarly synopsis or report of viewing exists, two short essays in different issues of Cartridge Quarterly East refer to the film
as 'extraordinary'd and 'far and away [James O. Incandenza's] most entertaining and compelling work.'e West Coast archivists list the film's gauge
as '16 ... 78 ... n mm.,' basing the gauge on critical allusionsf to 'radical experiments in viewers' optical perspective and context' as IJ(VÃ¬)'s
distinctive feature. Though Canadian archivist TÃªte-BÃªche lists the film as completed and privately distributed by P.Y.E.U. through posthumous
provisions in the filmmaker's will, all other comprehensive filmographies have the film either unfinished or UNRELEASED, its Master cartridge either
destroyed or vaulted sui testator.
