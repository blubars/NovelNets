substantial and politically motivated discount, seeing that the company's owned by the Quebec-sympathetic shadowy Albertan mogul who'd been
such a force in the anti-broadcast A.C.D.C., and who over a decade back had exploited the then-U.S.-owned then-Acme's severe PR and cash-flow
problems right after the serial Blammo Cigar tragedies to move in and hostile t/o the firm for about 30% of its real worth.
