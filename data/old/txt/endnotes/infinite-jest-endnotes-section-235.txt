     A Restriction means just no Overnight that week and an extra Chore; a House Restriction means you have to be back an hour after work and
nightly meetings; Full House is no leaving the House except for work and meetings, and 15 minutes to get back, and no even leaving to buy
smokes or a paper, or even to go out in the lawn for oxygen, and one violation means a Discharge: F.H.R. is Ennet's version of the Hole, and it's
dreaded.
