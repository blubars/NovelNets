      Known usually as 'drines -- i.e. lightweight speed: Cylert, Tenuate,3 Fastin, Preludin, even sometimes Ritalin. It's worth an N.B. that, unlike Jim
Troeltsch or the Preludin-happy Bridget Boone, Michael Pemulis (out of maybe some queer sort of blue-collar street-type honor) rarely ingests
any 'drines before a match, reserving them for recreation -- some people are wired to find heart-pounding eye-wobbling 'drine-
stimulation recreational.
a. Tenuate's the trade name of diethylpropion hydrochloride, Marion Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, technically a prescription antiobesity agent,
favored by some athletes for its mildly euphoric and resources-rallying properties w/o the tooth-grinding and hideous post-blood-spike crash that
the hairier-chested 'drines like Fastin and Cylert inflict, though with a discomfitting tendency to cause post-spike ocular nystagmus. Nystagmus or
no nystagmus, Tenuate's a particular favorite of Michael Pemulis, who hoards for personal ingestion every 75-mg. white Tenuate capsule he can lay
hands on, and does not sell or trade them, except sometimes to roommate Jim Troeltsch, who nags Pemulis for them and also goes into Pemulis's
special entrepÃ´t-yachting-cap and promotes still more of them on the sly, a couple at a time, feeling that they help his sports-color-commentary
loquacity, which secret promotions Pemulis knows about all too well, and is biding his time to retaliate, never you fear.
