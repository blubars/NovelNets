   A.k.a. 'E.L.D.,' that still-green shoot off the pure branch of math that deals with systems and phenomena whose chaos is beyond even
Mandelbrotian math's Strange Equations and Random Attractants, a delimiting reaction against the Chaos Theories of fractal-happy meteorologists
and systems analysts, E.L.D., whose post-GÃdelian theorems and nonexistence proofs amount to extremely lucid and elegant admissions of defeat
in certain cases, hands thrown up w/ complete deductive justification. Incandenza, whose frustrated interest in grand-scale failure was unflagging
through four different careers, would have been all over Extra-Linear Dynamics like white on rice, had he survived.
