        Having in her M.B.A. program absorbed the litigatory lessons of music producers v. cassette-tape manufacturers and film-production
companies v. videotape-rental chains, Noreen Lace-ForchÃ© protected InterLace's golden goose's copyrights by specifying that all consumer-TP-
compatible laser cartridges be engineered as Read-Only -- copyable Master cartridges require special OS-codes and special hardware to run,a and
you need licenses for both the codes and the hardware, which keeps most consumers out of the bootleg-cartridge business but is not a hard hurdle
to clear if you've got financial resources and political incentive (i.e., to dupe off a Master).
a. N.L.-F. had even rigged it so that Masters have to be run at 585 r.p.m. instead of a consumer-TP's cartridge-drive's 450 r.p.m.
