Disease, don't kid self that you can still buy rodneys in liquor stores or date your dealer's niece or think for a second you can still hang out in bars
playing darts and just drinking Millennial Fizzies or vanilla Yoo-Hoos, etc.
_ Volunteer Counselor Eugenio ('Gene') M. favors entomologic tropes and analogies, which is especially effective with brand-new residents fresh
from subjective safaris through the Kingdom of Bugs.
_ Don G.'s North Shore's vulgate signifier for trite/banal is: limp.
