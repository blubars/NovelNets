     It's against House rules to smoke upstairs in the bedrooms -- more Insurance Reasons -- and a week's Restriction is supposed to be mandatory,
and Pat's personally a fanatic about the rule, but Gately, much as he fears the grim boilerplate on the Insurance Sheet, always pretends he doesn't
see anything when he sees somebody smoking up here, since when he was a resident he actually used to sometimes smoke in his sleep he was so
tense, and every once in a while will wake up and find that he has again, i.e. lit a gasper and apparently smoked it and put it out all in his sleep,
down in bed in his Staff oubliette in the basement.
