     There's a Viewing Room on each subdorm floor, and room-size TP's w/ phone consoles and (if a kid wants) modems are standard issue, but only
E.T.A. juniors and seniors get to have actual cartridge-viewers in their subdorm rooms -- a two-year-old administrative concession the credit for
which goes largely to Troeltsch, who made such a pest of himself with Charles Tavis over the issue that Tavis finally relented just to keep the kid
from lurking in his office's waiting room, speaking into his fist, pretending to report on 'the flames of controversy surrounding individual rights
raging here in quaint and peaceful Enfield' -- and none of these viewers (likewise the Viewing Room's units) can have motherboard-cards for
Spontaneous InterLace Disseminations or for ROM-caliber games, which broadcasts and videoish games encourage a stuporous passivity that
E.T.A.'s philosophy now regards as venomous to the whole set of reasons the kids are enrolled there in the first place.
