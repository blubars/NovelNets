   Hal Incandenza had been thought for a while as a toddler to have some sort of Attention Deficit Disorder -- partly because he read so fast and
spent so little time on each level of various pre-CD-ROM video games, partly because just about any upscale kid even slightly to port or starboard
of the bell curve's acme was thought at that time to have A.D.D. -- and for a while there'd been a certain amount of specialist-shuttling, and many
of the specialists were veterans of Mario and were preconditioned to see Hal as also damaged, but thanks to the diagnostic savvy of Brandeis's
Child Development Center the damage assessments were not only retracted but reversed way out to the other side of the Damaged-to-Gifted
continuum, and for much of the glabrous part of his childhood Hal'd been classified as somewhere between 'Borderline Gifted' and 'Gifted' --
though part of this high cerebral rank was because B.C.D.C.'s diagnostic tests weren't quite so keen when it came to distinguishing between raw
neural gifts and the young Hal's mono-maniacally obsessive interest and effort, as if Hal were trying as if his very life were in the balance to please
some person or persons, even though no one had ever even hinted that his life depended on seeming gifted or precocious or even exceptionally
pleasing -- and when he'd committed to memory entire dictionaries and vocab-check software and syntax manuals and then had gotten some
chance to recite some small part of what he'd pounded into his RAM for a proudly nonchalant mother or even a by-this-time-as-far-as-he-was-
concerned-pretty-much-out-there father, at these times of public performance and pleasure -- the Weston MA School District in the early B.S.
1990s had had interschool range-of-reading-and-recall spelling-beeish competitions called 'Battle of the Books,' which these were for Hal pretty
much of a public turkey-shoot and approval-fest -- when he'd extracted what was desired from memory and faultlessly pronounced it before cer-
tain persons, he'd felt almost that same pale sweet aura that an LSD afterglow conferred, some milky corona, like almost a halo of approved grace,
made all the milkier by the faultless nonchalance of a Moms who made it clear that his value was not contingent on winning first or even second
prize, ever.
