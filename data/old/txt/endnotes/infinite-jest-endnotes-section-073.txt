   One of the graduate prorectors' little tasks is supposedly to go around to different Subdorm floors and check the rooms for things like are the
beds made up drum-tight, with unpleasant little extra drills added to the regimens of bed-making and toothpaste-cap-replacing slackers, though
few of the prorectors have the combination anality and drive actually to go around to their assigned rooms with a checklist, the exceptions being
Aubrey deLint, Mary Esther Thode, and the hatchet-faced Kenyan Tony Nwangi, who's got the Pemulis/Troeltsch/Schacht suite under extremely
beady scrutiny at all times.
