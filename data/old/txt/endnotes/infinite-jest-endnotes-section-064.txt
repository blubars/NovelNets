    Not 100% clear on this, but the thrust is that the T and Q are the two basic courses of study leading historically to the like 18th-century
equivalent of a H.S. diploma and a B.A., or maybe M.A., respectively, at nodes of hoary classicality like Oxford and Cambridge U. during the time of
Samuel Johnson -- more or less the original grammato-lexical-and-pedagogical hard-ass -- and that the trivium makes you take grammar, logic,
and rhetoric, and then if you're still standing you get the quadrivium of math, geometry, astronomy, and music, and that none of the classes --
including the potentially lightweight astronomy and music -- were in fact lightweight, which is one possible reason why the portraits of all these
classical and neo-classical B.A.s and D.Phil.s at Oxford and Cambridge look so pale and wasted and haunted and grim. Not to mention that the only
day E.T.A.s get off classes is Sunday, partly to make up for how much they're away from the classroom on trips; and back at E.T.A. classless
Sunday is a three-session day on the courts, all of which strikes people outside academies as almost fanatically brutal. For more general pedagogy
