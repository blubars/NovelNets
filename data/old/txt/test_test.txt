described the awful taste of hydro-chloride in the addict’s mouth
immediately after injection, he had researched the subject carefully.
She had been further led to believe that marijuana kept him from
using the drug with which he really had a problem, and so that if he
seemed anxious to get some once she’d offered to get him some it
was only because he was heroically holding out against much darker
deeper more addictive urges and he needed her to help him. He
couldn’t quite remember when or how she’d been given all these
impressions. He had not sat down and outright bold-faced lied to her,

grounds are traversable by tunnel. Avril I., for example, who never
leaves the grounds anymore, rarely travels above ground, willing to
hunch to take the off-tunnels between Headmaster’s House and her
office next to Charles Tavis’s in the Community and Administration
Bldg., a pink-bricked white-pillared neo-Georgian thing that Hal’s

the lobby, reception area, and administrative offices on Comm.-Ad.’s
first floor and the weight room, sauna, and locker/shower areas on
the sublevel below it. One large tunnel of elephant-colored cement
leads from just off the boys’ showers to the mammoth laundry room
below the West Courts, and two smaller tunnels radiate from the sauna
area south and east to the subbasements of the smaller,
spherocubular, proto-Georgian buildings (housing classrooms and
subdormitories B and D); these two basements and smaller tunnels
often serve as student storage space and hallways between various

navigable by any adult willing to assume a kind of knuckle-dragging
simian posture, in turn connect each of the subbasements to the
former optical and film-development facilities of Leith and Ogilvie

west of the Headmaster’s House (from which facilities there’s
also a fair-diametered tunnel that goes straight to the lowest level
