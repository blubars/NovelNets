      Coach Schtitt and Mario tear-ass downhill on W. Commonwealth on Schtitt's old BMW, bound for Evangeline's Low-
Temperature Confections in Newton Center, right at the bottom of what usually gets called Heartbreak Hill, Schtitt intense-faced
and leaning forward like a skier, his white scarf whipping around and whipping Mario's face, in the sidecar, as Mario too leans
way forward into their downhill flight, preparing to whoop when they bottom out.
