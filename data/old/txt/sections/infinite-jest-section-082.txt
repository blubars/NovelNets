     It's not like Boston AA recoils from the idea of responsibility, though. Cause: no; responsibility: yes. It seems like it all
depends on which way the arrow of presumed responsibility points. The hard-faced adopted stripper had presented herself as the
object of an outside Cause. Now the arrow comes back around as tonight's meeting's last and maybe best Advanced Basics
speaker, another newcomer, a round pink girl with no eyelashes at all and a 'base-head's ruined teeth, gets up there and speaks in
an r-less South Boston brogue about being pregnant at twenty and smoking Eightballs of freebase cocaine like a fiend all through
her pregnancy even though she knew it was bad for the baby and wanted desperately to quit. She tells about having her water
break and contractions start late one night in her welfare-hotel room when she was right in the middle of an Eightball she'd had to
spend the evening turning unbelievably sordid and degrading tricks to pay for; she did what she had to do to get high, she says,
even while pregnant, she says; and she says even when the pain of the contractions got to be too bad to bear she'd been unable to
tear herself away from the 'base-pipe to go to the free clinic to deliver, and how she'd sat on the floor of the welfare-hotel room
and freebased her way all through labor (that new Joelle girl's veil's billowing in and out with her breath, Gately sees, just like it
also was during the last speaker's description of the statue's orgasm in the catatonic's dysfunctional Catholic mother's devotional
photo); and how she'd finally delivered of a stillborn infant right there alone on her side like a cow on the rug of her room, all the
time throughout still compulsively loading up the glass pipe and smoking; and how the infant emerged all dry and hard like a
constipated turdlet, with no protective moisture and no afterbirth-material following it out, and how the emerged infant was tiny
and dry and all withered and the color of strong tea, and dead, and also had no face, had in utero developed no eyes or nostrils and
just a little lipless hyphen of a mouth, and its limbs were malformed and arachnodactylic, and there had been some sort of
translucent reptilian like webbing between its mucronate digits; the speaker's mouth is a quivering arch of woe; her baby had been
poisoned before it could grow a face or make any personal choices, it would have soon died of Substance-Withdrawal in the free
clinic's Pyrex incubator if it had emerged alive anyway, she could tell, she'd been on such a bad 'base-binge all that pregnant year;
and but so eventually the Eightball was consumed and then the screen and steel-wool ball in the pipe itself smoked and the cloth
prep-filter smoked to ash and then of course likely-looking pieces of lint had been gleaned off the rug and also smoked, and the
girl finally passed out, still umbilically linked to the dead infant; and how when she came to again in unsparing noonlight the next
day and saw what still clung by a withered cord to her empty insides she got introduced to the real business-end of the arrow of
responsibility, and as she gazed in daylight at the withered faceless stillborn baby she was so overcome with grief and self-
loathing that she erected a fortification of complete and black Denial, like total Denial. She held and swaddled the dead thing just
as if it were alive instead of dead, and she began to carry it around with her wherever she went, just as she imagined devoted
mothers carry their babies with them everywhere they go, the faceless infant's corpse completely veiled and hidden in a little pink
blanket the addicted expectant mother'd let herself buy at Woolworth's at seven months, and she also kept the cord's connection in-
tact until her end of the cord finally fell out of her and dangled, and smelled, and she carried the dead infant everywhere, even
when turning sordid tricks, because single motherhood or not she still needed to get high and still had to do what she had to do to
get high, so she carried the blanket-wrapped infant in her arms as she walked the streets in her velvet fuchsia minipants and
haltertop and green spike heels, turning tricks, until there began to be strong evidence, as she circled her block -- it was August
-- let's just say compelling evidence that the infant in the stained cocoon of blanket in her arms was not a biologically viable
infant, and passersby on the South Boston streets began to reel away white-faced as the girl passed by, stretch-marked and brown-
toothed and lashless (lashes lost in a Substance-accident; fire hazard and dental dysplasia go with the freebase terrain) and also
just hauntedly calm-looking, oblivious to the olfactory havoc she was wreaking in the sweltering streets, and but her August's
trick-business soon fell off sharply, understandably, and eventually word that there was a serious infant-and-Denial problem here
got around the streets, and her fellow Southie 'base-heads and street-friends came to her with not ungentle r-less remonstrances
and scented hankies and gently prying hands and tried to reason her out of her Denial, but she ignored them all, she guarded her
infant from all harm and kept it clutched to her -- it was by now sort of stuck to her and would have been hard to separate from
her by hand anyway -- and she'd walk the streets shunned and trickless and broke and in early-stage Substance-Withdrawal, with
the remains of the dead infant's tummy's cord dangling out from an unclosable fold in the now ominously ballooned and crusty
Woolworth's blanket: talk about Denial, this girl was in some major-league Denial; and but finally a pale and reeling beat-cop
phoned a hysterical olfactory alert in to the Commonwealth's infamous Department of Social Services -- Gately sees alcoholic
moms all over the hall cross themselves and shudder at the mere mention of D.S.S., every addicted parent's worst nightmare,
D.S.S., they of the several different abstruse legal definitions of Neglect and the tungsten-tipped battering ram for triple-locked
apartment doors; in a dark window Gately sees one reflected mom sitting over with the Brighton AAs that has her two little girls
with her in the meeting and now at the D.S.S. reference clutches them reflexively to her bosom, one head per bosom, as one of the
girls struggles and dips her knees in the little curtsies of impending potty -- but so now D.S.S. was on the case, and a platoon of
blandly efficient Wellesley-alum D.S.S. field personnel with clipboards and scary black Chanel women's businesswear were now
on the prowl in the South Boston streets for the addicted speaker and her late faceless infant; and but finally around this time,
during last year's awful late-August heat wave, evidence that the infant had a serious bio-viability problem started presenting itself
so forcefully that even the Denial-ridden addict in the mother could not ignore or dismiss it -- evidence which the speaker's
reticence about describing (save to say that it involved an insect-attraction problem) makes things all the worse for the empathetic
White Flaggers, since it engages the dark imaginations all Substance-abusers share in surplus -- and so but the mother says how
she finally broke down, emotionally and olfactorily, from the overwhelming evidence, on the cement playground outside her own
late mother's abandoned Project building off the L Street Beach in Southie, and a D.S.S. field team closed in for the pinch, and she
and her infant got pinched, and special D.S.S. spray-solvents had to be sent for and utilized in order to detach the Wool worth
baby-blanket from her maternal bosom, and the blanket's contents were more or less reassembled and were interred in a D.S.S.
coffin the speaker recalls as being the size of a Mary Kay makeup case, and the speaker was medically informed by somebody
with a clipboard from D.S.S. that the infant had been involuntarily toxified to death somewhere along in its development toward
becoming a boy; and the mother, after a painful D&C for the impacted placenta she'd carried inside, then spent the next four
months on the locked ward of Metropolitan State Hospital in Waltham MA, psychotic with Denial-deferred guilt and cocaine-
withdrawal and searing self-hatred; and how when she finally got discharged from Met State with her first S.S.I, mental-disability
check she found she had no taste for chunks or powders, she wanted only tall smooth bottles whose labels spoke of Proof, and she
drank and drank and believed in her heart she would never stop or swallow the truth, but finally she got to where she had to, she
says, swallow it, the responsible truth; how she quickly drank her way to the old two-option welfare-hotel window-ledge and
made a blubbering O2OOh. phone call, and then so here she is, apologizing for going on so long, trying to tell a truth she hopes
someday to swallow, inside. So she can just try and live. When she concludes by asking them to pray for her it almost doesn't
sound corny. Gately tries not to think. Here is no Cause or Excuse. It is simply what happened. This final speaker is truly new,
ready: all defenses have been burned away. Smooth-skinned and steadily pinker, at the podium, her eyes squeezed tight, she looks
like she's the one that's the infant. The host White Flaggers pay this burnt public husk of a newcomer the ultimate Boston AA
compliment: they have to consciously try to remember even to blink as they watch her, listening. I.D.ing without effort. There's no
judgment. It's clear she's been punished enough. And it was basically the same all over, after all, Out There. And the fact that it
was so good to hear her, so good that even Tiny Ewell and Kate Gompert and the rest of the worst of them all sat still and listened
without blinking, looking not just at the speaker's face but into it, helps force Gately to remember all over again what a tragic
adventure this is, that none of them signed up for.
