     At 0015h., 2 April, the medical attache's wife is just leaving the Mount Auburn Total Fitness Center, having played five six-
game pro-sets in her little Mideast-diplomatic-wife-tennis-circle's weekly round-robin, then hung around the special Silver-Key-
Members' Lounge with the other ladies, unwrapping her face and hair and playing Narjees <endnote>11</endnote> and all smoking kif and making
extremely delicate and oblique fun of their husbands' sexual idiosyncrasies, laughing softly with their hands over their mouths.
The medical attache, at their apartment, is still viewing the unlabelled cartridge, which he has rewound to the beginning several
times and then configured for a recursive loop. He sits there, attached to a congealed supper, watching, at 0020h., having now wet
both his pants and the special recliner.
