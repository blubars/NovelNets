     It's a herd of feral hamsters, a major herd, thundering across the yellow plains of the southern reaches of the Great Concavity
in what used to be Vermont, raising dust that forms a uremÃ­c-hued cloud with somatic shapes interpretable from as far away as
Boston and Montreal. The herd is descended from two domestic hamsters set free by a Watertown NY boy at the beginning of the
Experialist migration in the subsidized Year of the Whopper. The boy now attends college in Champaign IL and has forgotten that
his hamsters were named Ward and June.
     The noise of the herd is tornadic, locomotival. The expression on the hamsters' whiskered faces is businesslike and
implacable -- it's that implacable-herd expression. They thunder eastward across pedalferrous terrain that today is fallow,
denuded. To the east, dimmed by the fulvous cloud the hamsters send up, is the vivid verdant ragged outline of the annularly
overfertilized forests of what used to be central Maine.
     All these territories are now property of Canada.
     With respect to a herd of this size, please exercise the sort of common sense that come to think of it would keep your thinking
man out of the southwest Concavity anyway. Feral hamsters are not pets. They mean business. Wide berth advised. Carry nothing
even remotely vegetablish if in the path of a feral herd. If in the path of such a herd, move quickly and calmly in a direction
perpendicular to their own. If American, north not advisable. Move south, calmly and in all haste, toward some border metropolis
-- Rome NNY or Glens Falls NNY or Beverly MA, say, or those bordered points between them at which the giant protective
ATHSCME fans atop the hugely convex protective walls of anodized Lucite hold off the drooling and piss-colored bank of
teratogenic Concavity clouds and move the bank well back, north, away, jaggedly, over your protected head.
