     Between Gerhardt Schtitt's pipe and Avril Incandenza's Benson & Hedges and certain cheeks full of chewing tobacco -- plus
the maddening cooking-smells of honey and chocolate and real high-lipid walnuts from the kitchen vents, plus over 150 very fit
bodies only some of which have been showered on this day off -- the dining hall is warm and close and multi-odored. Mario as
auteur opts for his late father's parodic device of mixing real and fake news-summary cartridges, magazine articles, and historical
headers from the last few great daily papers, all for a sort of time-lapse exposition of certain developments leading up to
Interdependence and Subsidized Time and cartographic Reconfiguration and the renewal of a tight and considerably tidier
Experialist U.S. of A., under Gentle:

Macintosh, slapping their knees and pointing to the monitor and elbowing each other in the ribs, nibbling at inexplicably-appeared
boxes of popcorn, with a Voiceover: 'Cartridges by Modem! Just Insert a Blank Diskette! Break Free of the Confinement of Your

from a black-acetate (one of O. Stice's old Fila warm-up tops) background in vintagely allusive old-b&w-film style, with a sonic
background of that sad sappy Italianate stuff Scorcese had loved for his own montages, with the headlines lap-dissolving into
transverse-angled shots of a modest, green-masked Gentle accepting tight-lipped handshakes from Mexican and Canadian officials
in an agreement to make the U.S. President the first Chair of the Organization of North American Nations, with Mexican
Presidente and new heavily guarded Canadian P.M. to be co-Vice Chairs. Gentle's first State of the O.N.A.N. Address, delivered
before a triple-size Congress on the very last day of 'B.S.' solar time, holds out the promise of a whole bright spanking new
millennium of sacrifices and rewards and Interdependence's 'not impossibly radically altered new look,' continent-wide.
