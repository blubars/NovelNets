      It was yrstruly and C and Poor Tony that crewed that day and everything like that. The AM were wicked bright and us a bit
sick however we scored our wake ups boosting some items at a sidewalk sale in the Harvard Squar where it were warm upping
and the snow coming off onnings and then later Poor Tony ran across an old Patty citizen type of his old aquaintance from like the
Cape and Poor Tony got over and pretended like he would give a blow job On The House and we got the citizen to get in his ride
with us and crewed on him good and we got enough $ off the Patty type to get straightened out for true all day and crewed on him
hard and C wanted we should elemonade the Patty's map for keeps and everything like that and take his ride to this understanding
slope strip shop he knows in Chinatown but Poor Tony turns white as a shit and said by no means and put up an arguement and
everything like that and we just left the type there in his vehicle off Mem Dr we broke the jaw for insentive not to eat no cheese
and C insisted and was not 2Bdenied and took off one ear which there was a mess and everything like that and then C throws the
ear away after in a dumster so yrstrulys' like so what was the exact pernt to that like. The dumster was with the dumsters out by
Steves' donuts in the Enfield Squar. We go back to the Brighton Projects to cop and Roy Tony was always there on his bench in
the Playground in late AM but now all the Project Nigers was awake and out in the Playground and it was tense but it was day
time and everything like that and we cop half a bundle from Roy Tony and we go down to the library at Copley where we stash
our personnel works when we crewed and went into the mensroom where there was severel works on the floor allready that early
and got straight in the stall and C and yrstruly had a beef about who shot three and who got two and we made Poor Tony give us
up his third bag and then but we had to cop for that nite and tomorrow AM still which was XMas and had to cop in advance, its' a
never ending strugle its' a full time job to stay straight and there is no vacation for XMas at anytime. Its' a fucking bitch of a life
dont' let any body get over on you diffrent. And back we go to the Harvard Squar however on arrival Poor Tony wanted he should
hang for lunch time with his red leather fags in the Bow&Arrow and pretty much I can tolerate fags when alone but together
yrstruly I cant' fucking stand fags and yrstruly and C said fuck this shit and we screwed out and go up to the Central Squar where
it was cool offing and the onnings re freezing and everything like that and snowing and boosted NyQuil at the CVS Drug where
we go to the mop aile and employ a mophandle in tilting the mirror over the NyQuil aile and boosted NyQuil in Cs' coat and got
messed up on NyQuil and scored a bookbag off a foran slope studn type kid on the Redline platform but it only had books and
disks and the diskcase was fucking plastic and into a dumster with it it goes but also at this time we come up and run into Kely
Vinoy that was working her corner by the dumster by Cheap-O records in the Squar by the email place and shes' dopesick having
a conversession with Eckwus and an other man and Eckwus said he said Stokely Darkstar just got freetested again at the Fenway
and confirmed a big Boot 8.8 hes' got the Virus for sure and Purpleboy said he said Dark-star said how if he was going down he
didnt' give a shit and wasnt' going to give a shit if he gave some others the Virus thru trancemission and the Word was out&about
dont' share Stokely Darkstars' works dont' use works off Stokely Darkstar no matter how sick you are even if your' dyng for it get
other works. Like C said any thing would count in your mind when your' sick and had copped and was minus works and Darkstar
had works. We all every crew with heads left have personnel works for only ourselves that we use except blownout old hose like
Kely and Purpleboy there Man takes there $ and there works and Hes' the only one can give them there shots and keep Kely just
this side of dopesick 24-7 for insentive for her to make him more $ and everything like that, theres' nothing wurse than a Pimp and
Boston Pimps are the wurst there' 10X wurse than NYC Pimps that are supperst to be so hartless in NYC where yrstruly petaled
ass in the Columbus Squar for a time of my youth like Stokely Darkstar before departing for green pastures, and we had a
conversession but were' coming down and it was getting dark and snowing for a White XMas and if we didnt' crew before like
2200 Roy Tonys' Nigers would be too drunk to keep them from beefing with us and thered' be a beef and everything like that if we
go to cop after 2200 and who needs a grief so back we Redline to the Harvard Squar and all the foran studns are in the bars and we
locate Poor Tony smoking hash with fags back of Au Bon Pain and say lets roll a foran studn stuck here for XMas in the bars and
cop before 2200 and so we all go on the ice from the frozen melted snow to the Bow&Arrow in the Squar with Poor Tony and
Lolasister and Susan T. Cheese who I fucking cant' stand and got in there and made Susan T. Cheese buy beers and we wait and
no studns are leaving alone to roll but a older type individual who any body could see is no studn but is legless on shots alone at
the bar fucking shatered slumped over is getting ready to depart for green pastures and Poor Tony tells Lolasister to screw she
crews with Poor Tony some times but not if its' wet work and with Cs' involvement its' always wet work, and yrstruly I inform
Susan T. Cheese she new better than not to screw as well and the older individual de parts shatered and holding onto walls in a
hiclass and promising coat for the possibility of $ and pernts his old nose this way and that and everything like that thru the
Bow&Arrow window C wipes the steam off, and has a conversession with a Santaclaus ringing a big bell for the kettle and were'
like Jesus its' a never ending strugle to wait and cop but after awhile finally after stifing the Santaclaus we watch he picks a
direction finally at last up Mass Ave toward the Central Squar on foot, and Poor Tony beats it around the block to get up in front
of him around the block on the ice in his fucking heels and feather snake around his neck and gets him some how Poor Tony
always knows how over to the dumsters' alley by Bay Bank off Sherman St, and yrstruly and C crew on the individual and roll
him and C messes up his older map to a large degree and we leave him in no condition to eat cheese in a snow drift of materil
under the dumster, and C again wants to siphon out a vehicle on Mass Av and set him on fire but he has 400 $ on his person and
then some and a coat with a fury collar and a watch we realy scored and C even gosofar to take the non studns' shoes which they
dont' fit, and in the dumster they go.
     And but so but back we go to the Brighton Projects but its' post 2200 its'
     too late Roy Tony hasnt' got his pissboys out hes' not open for comerce and yet it is like a Niger Convenssion in the
Playground of the Brighton Projects with there glass pipes and there Crown Royal in purple bags and everything like that in the
Playground of the Projects and if they smell were' holding this kindof $ amounts they will crew on us in numbers there' animals at
nite with there purple velvet bags and p-dope and Redi Rok crack, one large Niger in a Patriots hat has a hart incident and
downhegoes on the black top by the swing set right in front of us and none of his brothers unquot gosofar to do any thing he lays
there there' animals at nite and we screw out with rickytick speed from the Brighton Projects, and we converse. And Poor Tony
wants to just go over the line to the Enfield Squar and try and just cop p-dope from Delphina down by the Empire hangers or else
what else hang with the fags at Steves' donuts and hear who else is holding weight in Enfield or Allston and everything like that,
but Delphinas' p is from bunk the Word is out&about that its' all Manitol and kwai9 you might as well fucking cop XLax or
Schweppes and C dopeslaps Poor Tony and C wants to Redline down to Chinatown but Poor Tony turns white as a shit and says
Chinatowns' too dear in $ and everything like that, even for like bundles, Dr. Wo is 200 $ but atleast its' always good and but we
have 400 $ and then some and C pernts out we can fucking well afford Wos' well known exellent skeet for once at XMas and Poor
Tony stamps a hiheel and says but how weve' got enough $ to stay straight and get Lolasister straight for XMas and all lay up and
not have to never ending strugle at XMas and two or more days after that if we dont' blow it on XMas Eve in Chinatown instead
of waiting which is a good pernt but when has any body known C to ever wait he gets dopes√≠ck faster than us and everything like
that and is all piss and vinegar for Wo and starting with the Shivers and with the noses' mucis all ready and everything like that
and C is not 2Bdenied and we say we are screwing down to Chinatown and if Poor Tony dont' want to come he can take a like a
giant breath and hold it in the Squar until we get back and well' cop for him, and Poor Tony says he might be a dicksucking fag
but hes' not a starry eyed' moroon.
     And so offwego and everything like that with 400 $ on the Orangeline, and thru a fucked up circumstances yrstruly and C
almost end up raping a older type nurse in a white nurses' uniform and coat on the train but we dont' and but Poor Tony seems
white and detracted on the train playng with his feather snake and says he says he seems in his mind maybe to recall an
involvment in some type deal where Dr. Wo might of got slightly got over on and burnt and that maybe down in Chinatown we
could air on the side of low profiles and try to cop some where else except from the Wos'. Except Dr. Wo is who we know. C is
Wos' former aquaintance from crewing with slopes on the North shore for Whity Sorkin in the days of his youth. C is not
2Bdenied. And so at the Orangeline Tstop we grab a fat cab to about two blocks from Hung Toys and screw out of the cab at a
light and the thing with fat cabbies is they cant' run after you and Poor Tony is pisser to watch tearassing it down the street in
hiheels with a feather stoal. Poor Tony runs right by the front of Hung Toys, this is by pryor agreement to wait for us low profile
down the street and yrstruly and C go in Hung Toys where they dont' open till 2300 and sell tea unquot like 100 Proof tea till all
hours and everything like that and never get Inspected because Dr. Wo has arrangements with Chinatowns' Finest. XMas is
noncelebrated in Chinatown. Dr. Wo a good thing about Wo is hes' always there in Hung Toys at known times. Here theres' all old
slope racial type ladies sitting in booths eating noddles and drinking quot tea out of white cups the size of a shotglass and
everything like that. With small slope kids tearassing it all over and older men in like jew caps and skinny beerds out of just the
middle of there chin but Dr. Wo is only middle aged and wears iron glasses and a tie and looks more like a banker for a slope but
he is 100 % business and icecold all the way down for slope type comerce plus hes' connected bigtime and not to be fucked or got
over on if some body has a head left and yrstruly I cant' believe Poor Tony would ever take part of tryng to crew on Wo who he
knows thru C in even the smallest comerce and if he did C says he sure never heard about it nor saw any of the skeet or anything
like that, and why. Cs' the one that knows Wo. We arranged Poor Tony to wait for us out side and try to be low profile. Its' sub 0
snow and hes' in a leather spring coat and stoal and brown wig thats' not as good as a hat and hell' freeze his low profile balls off
and C was tryng to smile and he told Dr. Wo we needed three bundles and Dr. Wo was smiling in his slope manner said the
boosting life must surely be exellent and C laughed and said most exellent Cs' tight with slopes he does the talking and everything
like that, and he says were' going to lay up low profile for the XMas vacation and not crew because I had a rape type situation
from an older nurse last nite on the T and almost got pinched by the Ts' Finest and Dr. Wo nods in a special subservant manner he
uses for non slopes who hes' realy polite with but hes' a dictater to his slopes when we see him with his subservant slopes but with
us were' allike most polite and everything like conversession and its' nice but expensive but it feels nice at the time but Wo
finishes his so called tea and Wo goes back behind the curtains in the back of Hung Toys thats' a giant brightred curtain with
purple mountains or hills and clouds that are flyng snakes with leather wings that is one curtain yrstruly would want to boost for
personnel hanging use that no body that isnt' a slope and isnt' in with Wo cant' never go behind it but you can see when he opens it
and goes behind the curtain it looks like merly more old slope ladies sitting on packing cases with slope writing eating more
noddles in bowls they hold about like a millmeter from their yellow maps and everything like that. Slopes rarly stop shovling in
the old noddles. Stokely Darkstar calls them maggoteaters and subservant slopes keep going in and out of the curtain while Wos'
back there a longer than avrege time and Cs' got the Shivers and starting to jones and dope-fiends are full of super station and he
says to yrstruly he says the fuck he says maybe what if Poor Tony realy did take part with burning Wo and what if a slope sees
Poor Tony out side and is one of these slopes going in and out of the curtain maybe telling Wo, like ratting out Poor Tony as our
aquaintance, and my muds is starting and were' jonesing super statiously over PT and wheres' Wo behind the curtain and
everything like that, tryng to smile and conversession ultralow, drinking quot tea thats' like schnapps only wurse and green. And
we jones and Dr. Wo comes back finally at last out smiling subservantly with all the wonderful skeet three bundles in a newspaper
who could fucking read it but the pictures are of slope VIPs' in suits and Wo sits down, and Wo never sits down at the booth with
the skeet it isnt' done in his comerce, and Wos' hands are folded over our skeet in the thing and Wo smiling says he asks C if
weve' seen goodold Poor Tony or Susan T. Cheese around we crew with Poor Tony in boosting life did we not he said. C he says
PT is a fucking dicksucking fag queer and a proven cheeseater and wed' fucked up his map and Cheese and Lolasisters' map in a
beef and didnt' crew with fags since aprox the autum period. C is pouring mucis and tryng to smile cusually, Dr. Wo laughed in a
harty fashion and said exellent and Wo leaned over our skeet sayng if we should happenbychance to see Poor Tony or them to
please give Poor Tony his quite best regards and wish him prosparity and a thousand blisses. And everything like that. And we
promote the newspaper of skeet and Wo promotes our $ and very politely outwego and I admit it yrstruly wanted we should burn
Poor Tony and rickytick the fuck out of Chinatown but we go over down more by the China Pearl Place and Poor Tony is sortof
hunched behind a lightpoal with his gray teeth chatting in his dress and thin coat tryng to be low profile in his red coat and heels
around a million + slopes that all are subservants of Wo. And later after screwing out we didnt' tell him of what Wo said about
sitting down and asking about him and Cheeses' blisses and we screw to the Orangeline to our hot air blowergrate we use at nite at
the library behind the Copley Squar and we get our personnel works out from behind the brickworks behind the bush by the hot
blowergrate where we stash our works and were' eggerly into the first bundle and were' cooking up and notice Poor Tony doesnt'
the least bitch when yrstruly and C tie off first in line seeing as were' the ones that copped it and Poor Tonys' gotto wait as usal,
except I notice he doesnt' bitch even a little, normally Poor Tony keeps up this usal wine yrstruly learned how to not notice, but
when he doesnt' wine now that were' jonesing and the skeets' right there I notice hes' cusually looking like every place but at the
skeet which is unusal and C jonesing and with the Shivers cooking up tryng to keep his lighter lit in the hot airs' wind and snow of
nite, and I admit it yrstruly I get a wicked cold inside feeling even with all this hot air from the blowergrate blowing up from
under us and making our hair blow around and Tonys' feather snake pernt upword I yrstruly get a cold feeling of super station
once more, you get wicked super stations in this fucked up kindof shit life because its' a never ending chase and you get too tired
to go by much more than never ending habit and super station and everything like that so but I dont' say any thing but yrstruly I
have a cold super station about Poor Tony not wining while he makes like he has to cusually piss and takes a piss and the piss
steams up around the lower ares of the bush with his back turned away and isnt' looking around with interst or anything like that
you never turn your back on the skeet when its' partly your skeet which is wicked unusal which C is so eggerly dopesick he
doesnt' notice any thing past keeping the lighter lit. And so I admit it I yrstruly did yrstruly purplously let C tie off and boot up
first while I still cooked up, I did cook up unusally slow, fucking with the getting the snowmelt hot in the spoon and everything
like that yrstruly I let the lighter go out and took more time with the cotton and C had the Shivers wurst of us and cooks up the
fastest and would of got it anyway. Later with Cs' map elemonaded Poor Tony later conceited admitting Susan T. Cheese helped a
Worcester fag get over on Wo for a fronted bundle in autum is why. And all three bundles Wo give us in slope news was
Hotshots. Laced. It started the instantly C undid the belt and booted up we knew allready, yrstruly I and PT thearized it was Drano
with the blue like glittershit and everything like that taken out by subservant slopes it had that Drano like effect on C and
everything like that it was laced what ever it was C started with the screaming in a loud hipitch fashion instantly after he unties
and boots and downhegoes flopping with his heels pouning on the metal of the blower-grate and hes' at his throat with his hands
tearing at him self in the most fucked up fashions and Poor Tony is hiheeling rickytick over over C zipping up sayng he screams
sweety C but and stuffing the feather snake from his necks' head in Cs' mouth to shut him up from hipitch screaming in case
Bostons' Finest can hear involvment and blood and bloody materil is coming out Cs' mouth and Cs' nose and its' allover the
feathers its' a sure sign of Drano, blood is and Cs' eyes get beesly and bulge and hes' cryng blood into the feathers in his mouth
and tryng to hold onto my glove but Cs' arms are going allover and one eye it like allofa sudden pops outof his map, like with a
Pop you make with fingers in your mouth with all this blood and materil and a blue string at the back of the eye and the eye falls
over the side of Cs' map and hangs there looking at the fag Poor Tony. And C turned lightblue and bit thru the snakes' head and
died for keeps and shit his pants instanly with shit so bad the hot air blowergrate is blowing small bits of fart and blood and missty
shit up into our maps and Poor Tony backs offof over C and puts his hands over his madeup map and looks at C thru his fingers.
And yrstruly I take the belt off it goes without saying, and dont' even rethink or dream about tryng maybe a diffrent bag out of a
diffrent bundle from C for how could Wo know what bundle wed' cook up outof first so all three bundles must be Hot so I dont'
even dream even tho yrstrulys' Shiverng and mucis sick allready and now in payback Wo has our only $ to get straight with for
XMas. It might sound fucking low but the reason we had to leave the decesed body C in one of the librarys' dumsters is the reason
is because the Copley Squars' Finest know it is our personnel hot air blowergrate and if we leave C there its' a sure pinch for us as
known aquain-tance and a period of Kicking The Bird in holding in a cell but the dumster was empty of materil and Cs' head made
a fucked up sound when it hit the empty bottom and Poor Tony cried and wined and said he said he had no inkling that beast Wo
was that vindicative and poorold decesed C and how this was it hes' going to get clean from heronout and get a straightjob dancing
in a Patty type Club in the Fenway and everything like that on and on piss and wine. I didnt' say any thing. I had to rethink on the
T to the Squar if yrstruly I should elemonade Poor Tonys' map for keeps for payback on how he purplously lets C shoot up first
and wouldof let yrstruly shoot first even knowing, or make that cheese move and go back down the Orangeline to Wo and try and
get enough bags to get true straight eating cheese to Wo about the wherehouse that Poor Tony and Susan T. Cheese and Lolasister
with Eckwus crashed at now. Or like what. Yrstruly I almost was cryng. It was when Poor Tony took off his hiheels and wanted
yrstruly I should boost him like over the edge of Cs' bodies' dumster to get back what was left of his feather stoal out of Cs' mouth
that yrstruly I thought I decided what to do. But the connected slope Wo wasnt' even there in front of the Hung Toys curtain in the
early XMas AM, and then Poor Tony departed for green pastures and ate cheese, and it took yrstruly two days of Kicking The
Bird in the hall out side my Mumsters' apartment that for payback she locked the door before I yrstruly can get in a Detox to
atleast cop some methedoan and get three squars to stay down in yrstruly to start to thearize on what to try and do after I could
standup straight and walk upright again once more.
