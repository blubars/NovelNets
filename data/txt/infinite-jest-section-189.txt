        1. Methamphetamine hydrochloride, a.k.a. crystal meth.
2
  Orin's never once darkened the door of any sort of therapy-professional, by the way, so his takes on his dreams are always generally pretty
surface-level.
3
  E.T.A. is laid out as a cardioid, with the four main inward-facing bldgs. convexly rounded at the back and sides to yield a cardioid's curve, with the
tennis courts and pavilions at the center and the staff and students' parking lots in back of Comm.-Ad. forming the little bashed-in dent that from
the air gives the whole facility the Valentine-heart aspect that still wouldn't have been truly cardioid if the buildings themselves didn't have their
convex bulges all derived from arcs of the same r, a staggering feat given the uneven ground and wildly different electrical-and-plumbing-conduit
wallspace required by dormitories, administrative offices, and polyresinous Lung, pull-offable probably by on the whole East Coast one guy, E.T.A.'s
original architect, Avril's old and very dear friend, the topology world's closed-curve-mapping-Übermensch A.Y. ('Vector-Field') Rickey of Brandeis
U., now deceased, who used to wow Hal and Mario in Weston by taking off his vest without removing his suit jacket, which M. Pemulis years later
exposed as a cheap parlor-trick-exploitation of certain basic features of continuous functions, which revelation Hal mourned in a Santa's-not-real
type of secret way, and which Mario simply ignored, preferring to see the vest thing as plain magic.

  Those younger staffers who double as academic and athletic instructors are, by convention at North American tennis academies, known as
'prorectors.'
    5
      Known usually as 'drines -- i.e. lightweight speed: Cylert, Tenuate,3 Fastin, Preludin, even sometimes Ritalin. It's worth an N.B. that, unlike Jim
Troeltsch or the Preludin-happy Bridget Boone, Michael Pemulis (out of maybe some queer sort of blue-collar street-type honor) rarely ingests
any 'drines before a match, reserving them for recreation -- some people are wired to find heart-pounding eye-wobbling 'drine-
stimulation recreational.
a. Tenuate's the trade name of diethylpropion hydrochloride, Marion Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, technically a prescription antiobesity agent,
favored by some athletes for its mildly euphoric and resources-rallying properties w/o the tooth-grinding and hideous post-blood-spike crash that
the hairier-chested 'drines like Fastin and Cylert inflict, though with a discomfitting tendency to cause post-spike ocular nystagmus. Nystagmus or
no nystagmus, Tenuate's a particular favorite of Michael Pemulis, who hoards for personal ingestion every 75-mg. white Tenuate capsule he can lay
hands on, and does not sell or trade them, except sometimes to roommate Jim Troeltsch, who nags Pemulis for them and also goes into Pemulis's
special entrepôt-yachting-cap and promotes still more of them on the sly, a couple at a time, feeling that they help his sports-color-commentary
loquacity, which secret promotions Pemulis knows about all too well, and is biding his time to retaliate, never you fear.
6
  Lightweight tranqs: Valium-III and Valrelease, good old dependable Xanax, Dai-mane, Buspar, Serax, even Halcion (legally available in Canada,
unbelievably, still); with those kids inclined toward a heavier slide -- reds, Meprospan, 'Happy Patch' transder-mals, Miltown, Stelazine, the odd
injury-'scrip Darvon) never lasting for more than a couple seasons for the obvious reason that serious tranqs can make even breathing seem like
too much trouble to go to, the cause of a meaty percentage of tranq-related deaths being attributed off the record by Emergency Room personnel
to 'P.S.' or 'Pulmonary Sloth.'
7
  Top jr. players are for the most part pretty cautious with alcohol, mostly because the physical consequences of heavy intake -- like nausea and
dehydration and poor hand-eye interface -- make high-level performance almost impossible. Very few other standard substances have prohibitive
short-term hangovers, actually, though an evening of even synthetic cocaine will make the next day's Dawn Drills very unpleasant indeed, which is
why so few of E.T.A.'s hard core do cocaine, though there's also the issue of expense: though many E.T.A.s are the children of upscale parents, the
children themselves are rarely flush with $ from home, since the gratification of pretty much every physical need is either taken care of or
prohibited by E.T.A. itself. It's maybe worth noting that the same people hardwired to enjoy recreational 'drines also tend to gravitate toward
cocaine and methedrine and other engine-revvers, while another broad class of more naturally higher-strung types tend more toward the edge-
bevelling substances: tranqs, cannabis, barbiturates, and -- yes -- alcohol.
    8
      I.e.: psylocibin; Happy Patchesa; MDMA/Xstasy (bad news, though, X); various low-tech manipulations of the benzene-ring in methoxy-class
psychedelics, usually home-makable; synthetic dickies like MMDA, DMA, DMMM, 2CB, para-DOT I-VI, etc. -- though note this class doesn't and
shouldn't include CNS-rattlers like STP, DOM, the long-infamous West-U.S.-Coast 'Grievous Bodily Harm' (gamma hydroxybutyric acid), LSD-25 or -
32, or DMZ/M.P. Enthusiasm for this stuff seems independent of neurologic type.
a. Homemade transdermals, usually MDMA or Muscimole, with DDMS or the over-counter-available DMSO as the transdermal carrier.
9
  A.k.a. LSD-25, often with a slight 'drine kicker added, called 'Black Star' because in metro Boston the available acid usually comes on chip-sized
squares of thin cardboard with a black stencilled star on them, all from a certain shadowy node of supply down in New Bedford. All acid and
Grievous Bodily Harm, like cocaine and heroin, come into Boston mostly from New Bedford MA, which in turn gets most of its supply from
Bridgeport CT, which is the true lower intestine of North America, Bridgeport, be advised, if you've never been through there.
10
   Like most sports academies, E.T.A. maintains the gentle fiction that 100% of its students are enrolled at their own ambitious volition and not that
of, say for instance, their parents, some of whom (tennis-parents, like the stage-mothers of Hollywood legend) are bad news indeed.
11
   An involved Arab women's game involving little shells and a quilted gameboard -- rather like mah jongg without rules, by the diplomatic and
medical husbands' estimate.
    12
       Meperedine hydrochloride and pentazocine hydrochloride, Schedule C-II and C-IVa narcotic analgesics, respectively, both from the good folks
over at Sanofi Winthrop Pharm-Labs, Inc.
a. Following the Continental Controlled Substance Act of Y.T.M.P., O.N.A.N.D.E.A.'s hierarchy of analgesics/antipyretics/anxiolytics establishes drug-
classes of Category-II through Category-VI, with C-II's (e.g. Dilaudid, Demerol) being judged the heaviest w/r/t dependence and possible abuse,
down to C-VTs that are about as potent as a kiss on the forehead from Mom.
13
   Though masked in the evidentiary photo and never once given up or named by Gately to anyone, this can be presumed to have been one Trent
('Quo Vadis') Kite, Gately's old and once-gifted friend from his Beverly MA childhood.
14
   This A.D.A.'s little personal trademark was that he always wore an anachronistic but quality Stetson-brand businessman's hat with a decorative
feather in the band, and frequently touched or played with the hat in tense situations.
15
   The Bureau of Alcohol/Tobacco/Firearms, at that time under the temporary aegis of the United States Office of Unspecified Services.
16
   Extremely unpleasant Québecois-insurgents-and-cartridge-related subsequent developments make it clear that this was (again) Trent ('Quo
Vadis') Kite.
17
   The codeineless kind, though -- almost the first physical datum Gately took in in the nasty flashbulb-flash shock of the occupied bedroom's light
coming on, to give you an idea of an oral-narcotics man's depth of psychic investment.
18
   On top of the seascape safe's more negotiable contents, themselves on top of an unplugged and head-parked and absolutely top-hole genuine
InterLace state-of-the-art TP/viewer ensemble in a multishelved hardwood rollable like entertainment-system-console thing, with a cartridge-dock
and double-head drive in a compartment underneath with doors with classy little brass maple-leaf knob things and several shelves crammed tight
with upscale arty-looking film cartridges, which latter Don Gately's colleague just about drooled all over the parquet flooring at the potential
discriminating-type-fence-value of, potentially, if they were rare or celluloid-transferred or not available on the InterLace Dissemination Grid.
19
   'Une Personne de I'Importance Terrible,' presumably.

   Fluorescence has been banned in Quebec, as have computerized telephone solicitations, the little ad-cards that fall out of magazines and have to
be looked at to be picked up and thrown in the trash, and the mention of any religious holiday whatsoever to sell any sort of product or service, is
just one reason why his volunteering to come live down here was selfless.

       JAMES O. INCANDENZA: A FILMOGRAPHY3
    The following listing is as complete as we are able to make it. Because the twelve years of Incandenza's directorial activity also coincided with
large shifts in film venue -- from public art cinemas, to VCR-capable magnetic recordings, to InterLace TelEntertainment laser dissemination and
reviewable storage disk laser cartridges -- and because Incandenza's output itself comprises industrial, documentary, conceptual, advertorial,
technical, parodic, dramatic noncommercial, nondramatic ('anti-confluential') noncommercial, nondramatic commercial, and dramatic commercial
works, this filmmaker's career presents substantive archival challenges. These challenges are also compounded by the facts that, first, for
conceptual reasons, Incandenza eschewed both L. of C. registration and formal dating until the advent of Subsidized Time, secondly, that his
output increased steadily until during the last years of his life Incandenza often had several works in production at the same time, thirdly, that his
production company was privately owned and underwent at least four different changes of corporate name, and lastly that certain of his high-
conceptual projects' agendas required that they be titled and subjected to critique but never filmed, making their status as film subject to
controversy.
   Accordingly, though the works are here listed in what is considered by archivists to be their
   a. From Comstock, Posner, and Duquette, The Laughing Pathologists: Exemplary Works of the Anticonfluential Après Garde: Some Analyses of
the Movement Toward Stasis in North American Conceptual Film (w/ Beth B., Vivienne Dick, James O. Incandenza, Vigdis Simpson, E. and K.
Snow).' ONANite Film and Cartridge Studies Annual, vol. 8, nos. 1-3 (Year of D.P. from the A.H.), pp. 44-117.
   probable order of completion, we wish to say that the list's order and completeness are, at this point in time, not definitive.
   Each work's title is followed: by either its year of completion, or by 'B.S.,' designating undated completion before Subsidization; by the
production company; by the major players, if credited; by the storage medium's ('film' 's) gauge or gauges; by the length of the work to the
nearest minute; by an indication of whether the work is in black and white or color or both; by an indication of whether the film is silent or in sound
or both; by (if possible) a brief synopsis or critical overview; and by an indication of whether the work is mediated by celluloid film, magnetic video,
Interlace Spontaneous Dissemination, TP-compatible InterLace cartridge, or privately distributed by Incandenza's own company(ies). The
designation UNRELEASED is used for those works which never saw distribution and are now publicly unavailable or lost.

such an extent that he has a cerebral hemorrhage and collapses onstage well before Marat's scripted death, whereupon the play's nearsighted
director (Ogilvie), mistaking the actor who plays Sade (Johnson) for Incandenza, throws Sade into Marat's medicinal bath and throttles him to
death, whereupon the extra-dramatic figure of Death ('Psychosis') descends deus ex machina to bear Marat (Leith) and Sade (Johnson) away, while

Y.T.M.P. Though no scholarly synopsis or report of viewing exists, two short essays in different issues of Cartridge Quarterly East refer to the film
as 'extraordinary'd and 'far and away [James O. Incandenza's] most entertaining and compelling work.'e West Coast archivists list the film's gauge
as '16 ... 78 ... n mm.,' basing the gauge on critical allusionsf to 'radical experiments in viewers' optical perspective and context' as IJ(Vì)'s
distinctive feature. Though Canadian archivist Tête-Bêche lists the film as completed and privately distributed by P.Y.E.U. through posthumous
provisions in the filmmaker's will, all other comprehensive filmographies have the film either unfinished or UNRELEASED, its Master cartridge either

   In other words, M. Fortier and the A.F.R. (as far as Marathe knew) believed that Marathe was functioning as a kind of 'triple agent' or duplicitous
'double agent' -- at Fortier's direction, Marathe had pretended to approach B.S.S. seeking to trade knowledge of the A.F.R.'s anti-O.N.A.N. activities
for protection and medical care for his hideously ill wife (Marathe's) -- only (as far as Marathe can know) Marathe and very few B.S.S. operatives
know that Marathe is now only pretending to pretend to betray, that M. Steeply is fully aware that Marathe responds to B.S.S.'s summonses with
what M. Fortier believes is his (Fortier's) full knowledge, that M. Fortier is not (as far as Marathe and Steeply can reasonably posit) aware that
Steeply and B.S.S. are aware that Fortier is aware of Marathe's meetings with Steeply, and that Marathe's own violent death will be the smallest of
his (Marathe's) problems should his Mont-Tremblant countrymen come to suspect the even-numbered total of his final loyalties.

medical tech -- and is thus only pretending only to pretend.

    Not 100% clear on this, but the thrust is that the T and Q are the two basic courses of study leading historically to the like 18th-century
equivalent of a H.S. diploma and a B.A., or maybe M.A., respectively, at nodes of hoary classicality like Oxford and Cambridge U. during the time of
Samuel Johnson -- more or less the original grammato-lexical-and-pedagogical hard-ass -- and that the trivium makes you take grammar, logic,
and rhetoric, and then if you're still standing you get the quadrivium of math, geometry, astronomy, and music, and that none of the classes --
including the potentially lightweight astronomy and music -- were in fact lightweight, which is one possible reason why the portraits of all these
classical and neo-classical B.A.s and D.Phil.s at Oxford and Cambridge look so pale and wasted and haunted and grim. Not to mention that the only
day E.T.A.s get off classes is Sunday, partly to make up for how much they're away from the classroom on trips; and back at E.T.A. classless
Sunday is a three-session day on the courts, all of which strikes people outside academies as almost fanatically brutal. For more general pedagogy
here see P. Beesley's somewhat frumpy and dated B.S.-era Revival of the Humanities in American Education, or better yet Dr. A. M. Incandenza's
updated version of same, with its prose updated and typos eradicated and argument rather more keenly honed, available on CD-ROM through

    Some M.I.T.s are compulsive about taping the shows and then listening to the musics again and trying to track them down in stores and college
archives, not unlike the way some of their parents had killed whole evenings trying to parse out the lyrics on R.E.M. and Pearl Jam tapes, etc.
67
    A couple of the Enfield Marine Public Health Hospital Security officers know E.T.A.'s Hal Incandenza from having met his brother Mario when
James O. Incandenza had hired the officers as lineless figurant background-extra cops for both Dial C for Concupiscence and Three Cheers for
Cause and Effect. The E.M. officers are sometimes down in The Unexamined Life tavern on Blind Bouncer nights when Hal is in there with like
Axford, Hal hitting The Life quite a bit less frequently than Axford and Struck and Troeltsch, who rarely miss a Bring-Your-Braille-I.D. theme-night
at The Unexamined Life, and seem able to function during A.M. drills even after several parasolled Mudslides or the House-Specialty Blue Flame
cognac-based things you have to blow out before sipping from their huge blue-rimmed snifters. The E.M. cops are both young dim big good regular
blue(literally)-collar Boston guys, high-school tackles now going soft, their jowls razor-burned and purpling with gin, and they'll sometimes regale
the E.T.A.s w/r/t some of the more colorful E.M. specimens they're paid to keep secure. There's something a little compulsive about the cops'
particular interest in #5 chronic catatonics, especially. The E.M. cops call Unit #5 'The Shed,' they say, because its residents don't seem housed
there so much as more like stored there. The E.M. cops pronounce stored 'stew-wad.' The chronic catatonics themselves they refer to as 'objay
darts,' which is something else Don G. over in #6 has never understood. Over Mudslides, they'll often give little thumbnail anecdotes about various
of The Shed's objay darts, and one of the reasons why they regale the E.T.A.s only when Hal's down there at The Unexamined Life is that Hal is
the only E.T.A. who seems truly interested, which is the sort of thing your veteran off-duty cop can always sense. E.g. one of the objay darts
they're into is the lady who sits very still with her eyes closed. The cops explain that the lady is not catatonic in the strict sense of catatonic but
rather a 'D.P.,' which is mental-health-facility slang for Debilitatingly Phobic. Her deal is apparently that she's almost psychotically terrified of the
possibility that she might be either blind or paralyzed or both. So e.g. she keeps her eyes shut tight 24/7/365 out of the reasoning that as long as
she keeps her eyes shut tight she can find hope in the possibility that if she was to open them she'd be able to see, they say; but that if she were
ever to actually open her eyes and actually not be able to see, she reasons, she's lost that precious like margin of hope that she's maybe not blind.
Then they run through her similar reasoning behind sitting absolutely motionless out of a phobia of being paralyzed. After each anecdote-tale like
(they've got like an anecdote-routine, the E.M. cops), the shorter E.M. Security officer always uses his tongue to manipulate the little green parasol
from one side of his mouth to the other as he holds his snifter tight in both hands and makes his jowls accordionize as he nods and posits that the
terrifying thing is that the common unifying symptom of most of The Shed's objay darts is a terror so terrifying it makes the object of the terror
come true, somehow, which observation always makes both of the big dim workingmen shiver an identical and kind of almost delicious-looking
shiver, pushing their hats back and shaking their heads at their glasses, as Hal blows out the fire of the second Blue Flame they've bought him,
making a wish before he blows.

   NA = Narcotics Anonymous; CA = Cocaine Anonymous. In some cities there are also Psychedelics Anonymous, Nicotine Anonymous (also,

distances, the loyalty of a fine dog, religious zeal, relentless helpfulness, relentless other-folks'-moral-inventory-taking, the development of hard-
line schools of 12-Step thought, ad darn near infinitum, including 12-Step fellowships themselves, such that quiet tales sometimes go around the
Boston AA community of certain incredibly advanced and hard-line recovering persons who have pared away potential escape after potential escape
until finally, as the stories go, they end up sitting in a bare chair, nude, in an unfurnished room, not moving but also not sleeping or meditating or
abstracting, too advanced to stomach the thought of the potential emotional escape of doing anything whatsoever, and just end up sitting there
completely motion- and escape-less until a long time later all that's found in the empty chair is a very fine dusting of off-white ashy stuff that you
can wipe away completely with like one damp paper towel.

Aubrey deLint, Mary Esther Thode, and the hatchet-faced Kenyan Tony Nwangi, who's got the Pemulis/Troeltsch/Schacht suite under extremely
beady scrutiny at all times.

   Hal's private dread is that Tavis will want him to offer up his personal competitive map and dignity to John ('N.R.') Wayne -- who's never in
several matches lost more than three games in a set to Hal -- for the titillation of the alumni and patrons at the November Fundraiser-gala's
exhibitions, though this is pretty unlikely right before the What-aBurger, when Hal'll be apt to face Wayne in the semis anyway, and Schtitt isn't apt
to want an utter demapping that fresh in Hal's mind right before a major event.

   Hal Incandenza had been thought for a while as a toddler to have some sort of Attention Deficit Disorder -- partly because he read so fast and
spent so little time on each level of various pre-CD-ROM video games, partly because just about any upscale kid even slightly to port or starboard
of the bell curve's acme was thought at that time to have A.D.D. -- and for a while there'd been a certain amount of specialist-shuttling, and many
of the specialists were veterans of Mario and were preconditioned to see Hal as also damaged, but thanks to the diagnostic savvy of Brandeis's
Child Development Center the damage assessments were not only retracted but reversed way out to the other side of the Damaged-to-Gifted
continuum, and for much of the glabrous part of his childhood Hal'd been classified as somewhere between 'Borderline Gifted' and 'Gifted' --
though part of this high cerebral rank was because B.C.D.C.'s diagnostic tests weren't quite so keen when it came to distinguishing between raw
neural gifts and the young Hal's mono-maniacally obsessive interest and effort, as if Hal were trying as if his very life were in the balance to please
some person or persons, even though no one had ever even hinted that his life depended on seeming gifted or precocious or even exceptionally
pleasing -- and when he'd committed to memory entire dictionaries and vocab-check software and syntax manuals and then had gotten some
chance to recite some small part of what he'd pounded into his RAM for a proudly nonchalant mother or even a by-this-time-as-far-as-he-was-
concerned-pretty-much-out-there father, at these times of public performance and pleasure -- the Weston MA School District in the early B.S.
1990s had had interschool range-of-reading-and-recall spelling-beeish competitions called 'Battle of the Books,' which these were for Hal pretty
much of a public turkey-shoot and approval-fest -- when he'd extracted what was desired from memory and faultlessly pronounced it before cer-
tain persons, he'd felt almost that same pale sweet aura that an LSD afterglow conferred, some milky corona, like almost a halo of approved grace,
made all the milkier by the faultless nonchalance of a Moms who made it clear that his value was not contingent on winning first or even second
prize, ever.

   Granted, Pemulis, over the summer (he boards at E.T.A. during the summer but hasn't qualified for the European trip since Y.P.W.), had made
and distributed (at cost) a few copies of a highly amusing low-memory TP game whose graphics featured a picture of deLint and a mock-up of the
hell-panel from H. Bosch's tryptich The Garden of Earthly Delights, which TP game continues to enjoy a select late-night vogue among the sub-16's.

   Orin Incandenza knew that Joelle van Dyne and Dr. James O. Incandenza weren't lovers; Mrs. Avril Incandenza did not know that they weren't
lovers, although by the time of Joelle's acquaintance with him Jim wasn't in a position to be lovers with anybody, neurologically speaking, though
it's not clear to Joelle whether Avril even knew this, since Jim and Avril hadn't been intimate with each other, i.e. conjugally, for quite some time,
though Jim hadn't known the precise reason why Avril was so sanguine about their not being intimate until the incident with the Volvo, where
apparently Avril had been with someone (Orin would not say who or whether he knew who) in the Volvo and had idly -- and disastrously, whether
w/ unconscious intent or not -- and presumably post-coitally idly written the person's first name in the steam of the steamed-up car window, which
name had disappeared with the steam but had reappeared the next time the window had steamed up, which had been when James had been
driving to this very brownstone, to shoot Joelle in the weird wobble-lensed maternal Tm-so-terribly-sorry' monologue-scene of the last thing he'd
done, and then never shown her, and had ordered the cartridge's burial in the brass casket w/ him in the same testament in which he'd willed
Joelle an absurd (and addiction-enabling) annuity, which Avril'd never have lowered herself to the level of contesting, but which could hardly be
expected not to have solidified the appearance that they'd been lovers, Joelle and Jim.

   Maybe in like psychic opposition to their Moms's compulsive cleaning thing, both Orin when he was at E.T.A. and now Hal are horrific slobs. In
Hal's case this is facilitated by the fact that the third floor of Subdorm C's prorector is the incredibly lax and laid-back Corbett Thorp, who may
stutter and go in for half-baked motivational experiments on the younger players but never comes around with a white glove and clipboard. Mario
makes his bed without fail, but you have to keep in mind that it's not like he's got all that much else to do. Hal's fitted sheet and sheet are Bean-
James River flannels in matching green and black Night Watch plaid, and for a comforter he uses a green fiberfill winter-camp sleeping bag that's
of unknown origin and price because he got it for Xmas and it had all the tags removed.

   The fact that it's not at all clear day-to-day what this it and caring mean, or how you can be expected both to care passionately and not care at
all, that huge amounts of internal psychic energy get expended on trying to come to some acceptable understanding of all this stuff, particularly
from 16 to like 18, is not accidental or a weakness in E.T.A. pedagogy, in Schacht's opinion, though a sizable contingent of E.T.A.s view Schtitt as
bats and essentially a figurehead and choose to steer more by head prorector deLint's clipboard and reductive statistics, which at least afford you a
firm idea of where you stand, comparatively, at all times.

    'I fear I simply have to deny the insinuation that it's disloyal or ungrateful to find oneself troubled by certain quite glaring inconsistencies in this
master quote unquote Program you all seem to expect us simply to open up and blindly swallow whole and then walk around glazed with our arms
right out straight in front of us parroting, reciting.' 'Geoff-- Geoffrey, man, I don't think anybody's trying to insinuate anything over on you, brother.
I know I ain't trying to.'
    No, you simply sit there with your arms crossed nodding with that timeless patience that communicates condescension and judgment without
exposing you to responsibility for insinuating anything aloud.'
    'Maybe when I look patient I'm really trying to be patient with myself, for not finishing school and etcetera and having a hard time keeping up
with you.'
    This AA tactic of masking condescension behind humility....'
    'I guess I'm just sorry for you you're feeling frustrated with the Program today. I know there's lots of days I'm frustrated with it. So I don't know
what to say helpful to you except what they said to me, to just hang in there.'
    'One Day at a One Day at a One Day.'
    'Brother, that's just all I know to tell you that's worked for me. I know for me it don't matter if there's days I fucking hate it. I just have to do it.
And it don't help me or anybody else if I go around negativing on newcomers and trying to take out my issues on trying to fuck them up with God-
puzzles.'
    'Mr. Gately Sir, I found myself sitting tonight in yet another Alcoholics Anonymous Meeting the central Message of which was the importance of
going to still more Alcoholics Anonymous Meetings. This infuriating carrot-and-donkey aspect of trudging to Meetings only to be told to trudge to
still more Meetings.'
    'I hear you.'
    'As if, I mean, what's supposedly going to be communicated at these future meetings I'm exhorted to trudge to that cannot simply be
communicated now, at this meeting, instead of the glazed recitation of exhortations to attend these vague future revelatory meetings?'
    'I'm doing my best to stay with you here Day man.'
    'And tonight I'm just settling in in yet another uneven-legged chair, cultivating that glazed passive spectatorial state of mind that is clearly what
they're trying to inspire in the ephebe, settling in next to a positively redolent Emil M. and trying to hold my poor addled Denial-ridden mind open
with all available main, listening to this ravaged-looking Yalie in yellow slacks detail episodes of tremens whose gruesomeness interdicted any
possible Identification --'
    'I'm remembering I heard Pat tell you that thinking people who are walking ahead of you are following you is a pretty bad kind of D.T.s, brother.'
    'And I informed her that there's a well-known surveillance tactic known as the Box-surveillance, which involves certain members of the
surveillance team establishing themselves in front of the subject.'
    'Except I don't ever remember you explaining why a sociology teacher weaving his way from his fourth bar to his fifth bar is important enough
for four guys from some you-never-mentioned-what kind of conspiracy to be pulling this real complex surveillance thing.'
    '...'
    'Except I was interrupting your point you were sharing, I know, and I'm sorry.'
    'Your basic decency is why you're whom I bring my thoughts to, Don. You know that.'
    'That makes me feel good Day man.'
    'I mean to whom else might I speak? The girl who takes her eye out and fondles it? Poor Ewell with his obsessive tattoo charts? Lenz^
    'It makes me feel good you think I'm decent to talk to. That's supposed to be why I'm here. I sure needed to talk, at the start. Can you
remember where you were headed before I broke i--interrupted?'
    'Something this broken Ivy Leaguer said, some AA sally. He said that only one newcomer in a million actually trudges into an Alcoholics
Anonymous Closed Meeting and in fact doesn't belong there.'
    'Meaning doesn't turn out to have the Disease you mean.'
    'Yes. And that he said that quote if You -- looking right at yours truly, seemingly, with that wearily amused patient expression you all must
practice in front of the mirror -- he said that only one newcomer in a million doesn't belong here, and if quote You think You're that one-in-a-
million, You definitely belong here. And everyone howled with mirth, stomped their feet and blew coffee through their noses and wiped their eyes
with the backs of their hands and elbowed each other. Howled with mirth.'
    'But you were, like, unsmiling at it.'
    'And everyone labels as Denial or ingratitude what's actually horror, Don. The horror of acknowledging that you do apparently have some sort of
problem with mild sedatives and fine Chianti, and wanting with all sincerity to give every fair chance to a treatment-modality which millions swear
up and down has helped them with their own problem.'
    'You're talking about AA.'
    'To want very much to believe in it, and to try, and then to your horror find the Program riddled with these obvious and idiotic fallacies and
reductia ad absurdum which --'
    Tm going to need to ask you to try and say that again in words I can follow, Geoffrey, if you want me to be right there alongside with you. And
I'm sorry if that seems descending.'
    'Don, I am sincere when I say I'm frightened when I find that there are things about this allegedly miraculous Program's doctrine that simply do
not follow. That do not cohere. That do not make anything resembling rational sense.'
    'I'm with you on that one now, brother.'
    'Tonight's example of the one-in-a-million, say. Don, let me ask you, Don. In all earnest. Why shouldn't every human being in the world be in
AA?'
    'Now I'm not with you anymore again, Geoffrey.'
   'Don, why doesn't every featherless biped on earth qualify for AA? By AA's reasoning, why isn't everyone everywhere an alcoholic?'
   'Well Geoffrey man it's a totally private decision to admit the Disease, nobody can go tell another man he's --'
   'But indulge me for a moment. By AA's own professed logic, everyone ought to be in AA. If you have some sort of Substance-problem, then you
belong in AA. But if you say you do not have a Substance-problem, in other words if you deny that you have a Substance-problem, why then you're
by definition in Denial, and thus you apparently need the Denial-busting Fellowship of AA even more than someone who can admit his problem.'
   'Don't look at me like that. Show me the flaw in my reasoning. I beg you. Show me why not everyone should be in AA, given the way AA regards
those who don't believe they belong there.'
   'And now you don't know what to say. There's no cockle-warming cliche that applies.' 'The slogan I've heard that might work here is the slogan
Analysis-Paralysis' 'Oh lovely. Oh very nice. By all means don't think about the validity of what they're claiming your life hinges on. Oh do not ask
what is it. Do not ask not whether it's not insane. Simply open wide for the spoon.'
   'For me, the slogan means there's no set way to argue intellectual-type stuff about the Program. Surrender To Win, Give It Away To Keep It.
God As You Understand Him. You can't think about it like an intellectual thing. Trust me because I been there, man. You can analyze it til you're
breaking tables with your forehead and find a cause to walk away, back Out There, where the Disease is. Or you can stay and hang in and do the
best you can.'
   'AA's response to a question about its axioms, then, is to invoke an axiom about the inadvisability of all such questions.'
   'I ain't AA Day man. No one like individual can respond for AA.'
   'Am I out of line in seeing something totalitarian about it? Something dare I say un-American? To interdict a fundamental doctrinal question by
invoking a doctrine against questioning? Wasn't this the very horror the Madisonians were horrified of in 1791? Amendments I and IX? My
Grievance is disallowed because my Petition for Redress is a priori interdicted by the inadvisability of all Petitioning?'
   'I'm about to get fucking lapped here I'm so not-following. You honestly don't see what's a little whacked-out about what you're saying about
Denial?'
   'I'm thinking your failure to engage me on the question itself means either I'm right, and AA's whole Belonging-versus-Denial matrix is
constructed on logical sand, in which case horror, or else it means you're stupefied with condescending pity for me for some reason I fail to grasp,
doubtless because of Denial, in which case the look on your face right now is the same weary patience that makes me want to scream in meetings.'
   'So scream. They can't kick you out.'
   'How comforting.'
   'This is a thing I do know. They can't kick you out.'

   An anxiety-fest captured nicely by the banner-shaped posters deLint used to have D. Harde put up each fall over the senior-locker sections of
both locker rooms that had WINNERS NEVER HAVE TO QUIT until some of the other prorectors went to Schtitt and got him to make deLint take
them down.
94
   It's surely been spelled out already that prorectors teach one marginal class per term and serve as on-court assistants to Schtitt's
Lebensgefährtin Aubrey deLint, and that their existence at E.T.A. is marginal and low-prestige and their spiritual state on the low continuum
between embittered and accepting, and for many of the more neurasthenic E.T.A. students the prorectors are kind of repellent the way hideously
old people are repellent, reminding the students of the kind of low-prestige purgatorial fate that awaits the marginal and low-ranked jr. player; and
while a couple of the prorectors are feared, none of them is all that much respected, and they're avoided, and stick together with one another and
keep to themselves and seem on the whole sad, with that grad-schoolish sense of arrested adolescence and reality-avoidance about them.

   It's both perverse and kind of understandable that getting some sort of college scholarship (or 'Ride'), while very few E.T.A.s (and certainly not
Orin Incandenza) have any real kind of financial need, that nevertheless a scholarship is enormously important self-esteem-wise, since opting for
the college-tennis route in the first place is kind of an admission of defeat and a surrender of dearly held dreams of the professional Show.
98
   And to keep a distant but weirdly beady and obsessive eye on Mario, from whose lordotic presence in a room Tavis'd flee just as Avril was fleeing
from the temptation of overlobbying Orin on B.U., such that for a few days when both Orin and Mario entered a room there'd be the sound of a
tremendous collision in the hall outside as C.T. and Avril's flights' vectors met.

     The way a White Flagger formulates this, e.g., is that 99.9% of what goes on in one's life is actually none of one's business, with the .1% under
one's control consisting mostly of the option to accept or deny one's inevitable powerlessness over the other 99.9%, which just trying to parse this
out makes Don Gately's forehead turn purple.

     Some of their earliest dates were watching big-budget commercial films, and Orin had one time completely unpremeditatedly told her it was a
strange feeling watching commercial films with a girl who was prettier than the women in the films, and she'd punched him hard in the arm in a
way that just about drove him wild.

106
     There's a Viewing Room on each subdorm floor, and room-size TP's w/ phone consoles and (if a kid wants) modems are standard issue, but only
E.T.A. juniors and seniors get to have actual cartridge-viewers in their subdorm rooms -- a two-year-old administrative concession the credit for
which goes largely to Troeltsch, who made such a pest of himself with Charles Tavis over the issue that Tavis finally relented just to keep the kid
from lurking in his office's waiting room, speaking into his fist, pretending to report on 'the flames of controversy surrounding individual rights
raging here in quaint and peaceful Enfield' -- and none of these viewers (likewise the Viewing Room's units) can have motherboard-cards for
Spontaneous InterLace Disseminations or for ROM-caliber games, which broadcasts and videoish games encourage a stuporous passivity that
E.T.A.'s philosophy now regards as venomous to the whole set of reasons the kids are enrolled there in the first place.

     Sometimes, especially in early fall and late spring, this can involve a lapse of several weeks; WETA doesn't broadcast when most of the kids are
away at some competitive thing, and Saturday classes are likewise often canceled -- this is one reason why so many prorectors' classes are
relegated by Mrs. A.M.I, to Saturdays.

        Q.v. here later in the same day, 11/7, as Hal Incandenza sits on the edge of his unmade bed, undressed, with the good right leg curled under
him and the bad ankle soaking in a janitor-pail of dissolved Epsom salts, looking through one of Mario's old Hush Puppy shoeboxes of letters and
snapshots. Saturdays involve classes and drills and P.M. matches but no conditioning run or weight circuits. Afternoon's odd mismatched challenge
matches held on staff-squeegeed Center Courts under a steady metal sunless sky. The air still damp after lunchtime's rain. Hal's own odd match
was truncated when C-squadder Hugh Pemberton took a ball in the eye up at net and began wandering the service box in wobbled circles. Hal
skipped a quick trip down to the Pump Room and got to shower nearly solo in the main locker room. Tomorrow's Interdependence Day communal
supper at E.T.A. is a big deal and includes each person's own specially selected hat, plus real dessert, and a post-prandial Mario-made film, and
sometimes a sing-along. Hal and Pemulis, Struck and Axford and Troeltsch and Schacht and sometimes Stice have their own special private day-
before-I.-Day-ritualistic-supper-out-and-trip-to-The-Unexamined-Life blowout-gala, since Sunday is a day of total mandatory R&R. The untruncated
matches are winding down out there, Hal can hear. The sun is coming out just in time to go down. The Comm.-Ad. pipes start to moan and sing
with crowded showering kids. Pale net-shadows are starting to elongate acutely across the sidelines of the courts' north sides. Mario is more or less
the Incandenza family archivist ex officio. Mario has been closeted with Disney Leith all day preparing things for Sunday's postprandial gala and
filmiest. The phone sits mute atop the answering-machine attachment on the telephone's power unit's console. Its antenna is retracted and it
simply sits there, exuding the vague contained menace of mute phones. The phone's ringer sort of twitters instead of ringing. The audio-only
comm.-system's power console is bolted to a receptacle on the side of Hal and Mario's TP, and its red power light blinks at the slow liquid rate of a
radio tower. The phone and answering machine are hand-me-downs from Orin's days at E.T.A., old models of transparent plastic, so you can see
everything's quad-colored pasta of wires and chips and tin disks. The only message when Hal got in was from Orin at I4l2h. Orin had said he'd just
called to ask whether by any chance Hal'd ever realized that all of Emily Dickinson -- as in the Belle of Amherst Emily Dickinson, the canonical
agoraphobic poet -- that every single one of Ms. Dickinson's canonical poems could by sung without loss or syllabic distortion to the tune of 'The
Yellow Rose (of Texas).' 'Because I could not stop for Death He kindly stopped for Me,' Orin had sung illustratively onto the recording. 'I hope the
Father in the skies Will lift his little Girl.' Actually more like sort of sung. There'd been professional-locker-room sounds in the background -- locker
doors banging, bass voices on tile and steel, personal stereos, hisses of antiperspirant and styling-spritz. The odd enclosed echo of locker rooms
everywhere, junior or pro. 'On my volcano grows the Grass A meditative spot/ and so on. The fleshy pop of a professionally snapped towel on adult
skin. A black man's falsetto laughter. Orin's recorded voice said he'd just grabbed an odd free second to inquire what Hal's machine might make of
this fact.
   Hal spits Kodiak tobacco juice into an old rocket-emblazoned NASA glass on the bedside table, idly and for no special reason riffling through
densely packed letters tri-folded and packed upright, a kind of Rolodex of different mementos and postal correspondence Mario's rescued from
wastebaskets and recycling bins and dumpsters and quietly saved in shoeboxes. Mario has no problem with Hal perusing his closet's stuff. Mario's
closet has a canvas strap instead of a knob. Ideally there would also be a bucket of very cold water, and Hal would move the bad ankle from one
bucket to the other and back again. A whistle sounds from down near the girls' West Courts. Someone little in the hall outside the closed door
shouts 'Guess again!' to someone else farther down the hall. None of the Hush Puppy box's snail-mail letters are to or from Mario. Mario's bed is
loosely, unanally made. Hal's bed is unmade. Hal and Mario's mother had done her undergraduate Honors work at McGill on the use of hyphens,
dashes, and colons in E. Dickinson. The Epsom-water whitens his calluses. Unlaundered bedding swims around him. The phone twitters. Ample
make this bed, or Ample make this bed. The phone twitters again.

   Dear Filbert,3
   It's been a quiet week here on Mount Gawdforsakenb -- today is perishing hot, windless, quiet as a tomb, lush and pretty. Every floral unit on
the grounds has its pistil aprick and petals atremble in a truly shameless fashion, for the bees are about. The whole hill hums drowsily. Yesterday,
your Uncle Charles was accosted on the north path by a bumblebee that he alleges was so enormous it sounded like a tuba, and he dispatched Mr.
Harde and the grounds crew with skeet rifles and orders to ' . . .bring the Sikorski-sized bugger down.' I shall spare you details of the subsequent
misadventures of the grounds crew, two of whom are now recovering satisfactorily.
   The paucity of decibels here is due in part to all six A-teams' departure yesterday for Milan, with Gerhardt, Aubrey, Carolyn, and Urquhart at the
pedagogical tiller. It seems not so many moons ago that we were seeing you, Marlon, Ross, and the rest off on the European clay junket. I recall
pressing the maternal beak to the terminal window's glass, trying to make my Filbert out somewhere behind the airplane's impossible little bullet-
hole windows. I cried like a fool every time, as of course I did all over again yesterday, embarrassing everyone but Mario, who also cried.
   As for me, I've swotted and wakked all morning, cranking up your Uncle Charles's videophone and trying to cajole the editors of various
supermarket trade publications to run M.G.M.'sc latest plea for amending Less to Fewer'm those !*#!*# Express Check-Out lanes. One old editorial
codger said that he'd dearly love to help me out but that his newsletter was devoted exclusively to issues of promotional display. When I suggested
that a little comic relief in the form of the L------>F bulletin might not be amiss, he chortled. Chortling is good. We like chortling. However, I did
manage to twist the arms (harder to do telephonically than one might think) of Produce Weekly, Star Market s Quarterly Register, and
PriceChopper's Shelf and Cart, so the wheels of adjectival justice continue, albeit creakily, to turn.
   The very last gobbet of Academy news is that your Uncle Charles had his blood cholesterol tested late last week. Though the verdict rendered
was no worse than a rather unperspicuous "Normal to Upper-normal" (sic), the penultimate modifier has caused, as you might anticipate, much
pacing and high-decibel whingeing, as well as vows of eternal xerophagy from here on out. Your Uncle Charles has already, for some months now,
made a practice of swallowing three teaspoons of fish-liver oil just before he hurls the administrative skeleton bedward for the night. Your brothers
have taken to trekking over on slow nights to watch him swallow his oil, purely out of enthusiasm for the faces Charles makes as the stuff goes
gulletward. I e-ordered the poor man a low-lipid, artery-friendly cookbook as a sort of Whatthehell present the day the results came in, and your
Uncle Charles has already pored over the thing and marked several yummers. We're to have a swot at cabbage patties tonight, fast-laners that we
are. I do suppose the poor man will find a way to ladle rice brand into his toothpaste before this spasm of angst subsides. Bless his heart -- as it
were!
   My, this machine does let one maunder on. I'd best get back to harrying grocers. One of this fall's matriculates6 is the son of a man who's
apparently become an immensely wealthy Telegrocerf in the Upper Midwest, so perhaps the Express Lane-Solecism issue will simply disappear in
these here parts as well.
   It goes without saying that you are of course wearing your halo and mouth-guard at all appropriate times and eating at least one green, leafy
vegetable per day.
   Oh -- 'twas wonderful to hear about the arbitration and contract. Mr. deLint read a detailed account and told us all about it. Proud, as ever, to
know you.
   Miss You and Love You Lots, and c.

    'Mmyellow.'
    'Presenting Speedy Seduction Strategy Number 7.'
    'Orin. Happy Inter-Day Eve. E Unibus Pluram and so on. Still dodging the disabled?'
    'A proviso up-front, Hallie: Number 7 never misses.'
    'And not every Dickinson poem is singable to 'Yellow Rose,' O. Sorry to disappoint you. For instance like "Ample make this bed -- Make this bed
with awe" isn't even iambic, much less quatrameter/trimeter.'
    'Just a theory. Just tossing it out for the machine's consideration.'
    'A practice to be encouraged. This particular theory's unfortunately a dink. Plus I don't think you quite meant proviso.'`
    'Number 7 remains a no-miss proposal, though. Picture this. Obtain a ring. As in a wedding band. So you present yourself to the Subject as
visibly married.'
    'You know I hate these Strategy calls.'
    'Also of course works if you really do happen to be married. In which case you've got a ring already.'
    Tm sitting here soaking my ankle, O.'
    'The object being, to present yourself to the Subject as married, as in happily married, and you engage her in a conversation in which you make
a big deal of how head-over-heels in love you are with your wife, how wonderful she is, the wife, how blue and clean the pilot-light of passion still
burns in the central heating system of your love for her, your wife, even after all these several years you've been hitched.'
    Tm sitting here looking through an old box of letters to kill just a very few minutes before a bunch of us climb in the tow truck for Pemulis's
annual I.-Day-Eve town-painting.'
    'But as you're saying all this to the Subject, your manner is nevertheless indicating that you're attracted to her.'
    'It's poignant somehow that you always use the word Subject when you mean the exact obverse.'
    'But it's not like flirtatious or salivious, your manner. More like just strongly involuntarily attracted. Almost as if hypnotized against your will. Your
manner can indicate this just by following the Subject's conversational movements and changes of posture or facial expression in that sort of
vacant intense way a hungry person watches somebody eating. Following the movements of the fork as if memerized. With, of course now, the
occasional flicker of pain and conflict in your eyes, at the fact that here you are involuntarily memerized by somebody other than your serapic wife,
which the point --'
    'Time. Yo. I think you mean seraphic. I also think you meant lascivious and mesmerized.'
    'You know what your problem is, Hallie?'
    'I have just one problem?'
    'But hang on until you see that 7's worth not making me digress away from, though. Because the point being to get across how it's an incredible
tribute to the Subject's overwhelming female charms that you can even really even see her, the Subject, since you're so in love with your wife you
barely even see most women as even female anymore, much less be involuntarily attracted to the Subject, much less have maybe the thought of
infidelity skitter no matter how involuntarily across your devoted mind. And it's not like you'll have to volunteer any of this directly. The Subject'll
draw the observations on her own. That's the point of the conflicted flickers in your memerized eyes, or at the most an involuntary tortured groan,
a quick bite of the knuckle of the forefinger.'
    'A heel of the hand to the forehead or something like that.'
    'Get your manner down just conflicted-looking enough and the Subject herself'll actually start drawing you out on this fact, the involuntary
attraction that's so painful to you and so flattering and tributary to her.'
    'So wait. This is like a conversation where you're affecting all this flickering and groaning? Like you mean a cocktail-party-small-talk
conversation? Or do you just brandish your fake ring at some girl at a bus stop and start a tortured tribute to your seraphic wife?'
    'It takes place anywhere. Venue-adjustable. 7's portable and never-miss. The point is to maneuver the issue of your devoted attracted conflicted
pain to the point where you can appear to almost sort of break down and can ask the Subject in all tortured sincerity if she thinks your involuntarily
finding her so visibly female and attractive makes you a bad husband. Display vulnerability and ask her to evaluate the like integrity of your heart.
Seem desperate. Your whole married self-concept shaken. Practically beg the Subject to reassure you you're not a bad-hearted man. Plead with the
Subject to say what she thinks it might be about her charms that could drive your serapic wife even momentarily from your heart. You present the
attraction you feel for the Subject as this involuntary identity-threatening soul-searing-type crisis you just desperately need her help with, the
Subject's, person to person.'
    'Sounds very moving.'
    'And if it so happens you really are married, the additional advantage to 7's pitch is that you and the Subject both, however briefly, get to believe
it. The pitch. The involuntary passionate doomed knight-errant-type pitch.'
    'And of course, O., the Subject just happens to be married herself, often with small children, putting her directly in your crosshairs.'
    'A matter of what's the word personal preference and taste that doesn't impact 7's surefire no-miss quality one way or the other. It's the doomed
involuntary conflicted good-man's-downfall-type quality that no Subject can seemingly resist.'
    'Ainsi, then.'
    'Well O. the thing's sick. It's even sicker than 4. Was it 4? The one you said that Loach inspired, where you'd supposedly just that very day
dropped out of Jesuit seminary after umpteen years of disciplined celibacy because of carno-spiritual yearnings you hadn't even been quite in touch
with as carno-spiritual in nature until you just now this very moment laid eyes on the Subject? With the breviary and rented collar?'
    'That was 4, yes. 4's pretty much of a gynecopia also, but within a kind of narrower demographic psychological range of potential Subjects.
Notice I never said 4 was no-miss.'
    'Well you must be a very proud young man. This is even sicker. The fake ring and fictional spouse. It's like you're inventing somebody you love
just to seduce somebody else into helping you betray her. What's it like. It's like suborning somebody into helping you desecrate a tomb they don't
know is empty.'
    'This is what I get for passing down priceless fruits of hard experience to somebody who still thinks it's exciting to shave.'
    'I ought to go. I have a blackhead I have to see to.'
    'You haven't asked why I called right back. Why I'm calling during high-toll hours.'
    'Plus I feel some kind of toothache starting, and it's the weekend, and I want to see Schacht before Mrs. Clarke's confectionery day in the sun
tomorrow. Plus I'm naked.'
    'I'm surprised you were even there. In person. I was expecting the Disembodied Voice and asking you to call back ASAP on this. What is it out
there, 1600? Why aren't you outside hard at play? Don't tell me Schtitt started cancelling P.M.'S for I.-Day Eve.'
    'I tagged this kid Pemberton in the eye up at net. It was inadvertent. We were only four games in. He hit a big soft fluffy goose of an approach
and I was trying to handcuff him. I hit it at him only to handcuff him. He never even got his stick up. Right in the left socket. It made a sound like a
champagne cork. A prorector named Corbett Thorp said he thought Pemberton might have detached a retina. Something sure seemed detached.
He was walking around in diminishing circles like he'd been hit with a mallet.'
    'You sound really, like, remorse-riddled.'
    'Kitchens arid heat, O. I've taken my share of balls in various spots. And whence bizarre metric theories about Emily Dickinson all of a sudden, by
the way? And what's up with the lurking figures with wheelchairs?'
   'You're a Top-Ten junior stickman suddenly now this year, Hallie, what's Schtitt doing giving you a cloth mouse like Hugh Pemberton to bat
around anyway?'
   'You remember him?'
   'Who could forget a kid that looks like he's curtsying when he serves? With the white visor and the little amber glasses? That kid's been hanging
from the bottom of the ladder by his nails since he was nine.'
   'It's been carnage all week. Schtitt's playing the C teams against the A's. It's for the C's development, Donni said. Also because today word's
down from the tower some of the staff thought some of the A's looked tentative against Port Wash.'
   'They despise tentativity.'
   'I think they want us just short of cocky for the Fundraiser and then the WhataBurger, where Wayne's got a chance to knock this Veach kid off
the pole.'
   'Let's not forget you though either, H. I can get down for at least the WhataBurger semis if you get there, if you want incentive.'
   'As in in person, O.?'
   'Word is you're worth watching now.'
   'Word?'
   'I keep my ear to the cement, Hallie.'
   'At least for very short Subjects, I'd imagine.'
   'We take off for the Patriots that Friday, what is that like the 27th or -8th, but it's a Saturday afternoon game. I can be down there by midday
Sunday if you're still in the thick.'
   'You'll probably need to wear some sort of sign around your neck so I know it's you.'
   'So then you'll be up here just as we're down there, oddly, playing.'
   'It goes without saying you'd give me the advance skinny if anybody I didn't want to see was by any chance flying down there with you guys.'
   'The C versus A thing's been more like grotesque than confidence-building. Guys are taking out stress in kind of twisted ways. Struck beat
Gloeckner in 40 minutes and then made a show of revealing he'd had 3-kilo ankle-weights on under his socks. Wayne made van Slack cry right
there in front of everybody.'
   'Word is Wayne has exactly one gear.'
   'Then Thursday Coyle had his left wrist tied to his right ankle and was still beating this new kid Stockhausen until Schtitt sent Tex Watson down
to tell him to knock it off.'
   'So but the reason I'm really calling, Hallie.'
   'And you're being evasive about the dread about the disabled. The like rolling stalkers.'
   'I haven't seen wheel one in days. I'm thinking possibly this was a kind of very shy sort of fan club of people without legs that look up to me --'
   'Grotesque entendre, O.'
   '-- as, like, the ultimate leg. They use different ruses to follow me around and never come close or say anything because they're really shy
because they don't have legs. So now my mind's resting easier.'
   'Now if the roach- and spiders-at-heights fears'd subside you could really hold the head high.'
   'So the reason I'm calling.'
   'I already said I'd let you know when and if. No sightings of any journalists. Your Moment profiler.'
   'I'm actually glad I got you in person. I was going to ask you to call me ASAP.'
   Tm pleased to call you a sap whenever you like, O.'
   'That's below you. And I can hear you still chewing that grisly shit. That shit's going to make your lower jaw fall right off. I've seen it happen
down here, believe me. And you're wondering why the tooth problems all the time suddenly.'
   'Snuff's saliva-stimulating. It's actually oral-hygiene-enhancing, when you factor in all the extra brushing. The caries are Himself's legacy. You
know that. The Himself whose root canals put Dr. Zegarelli's kids through Andover.'
   'This basically nonsocial call, H., is because I need your feedback on some issues from these half-dozen or so very complex and far-ranging and
in-depth conversations I had with a certain Subject.'
   'Not the mobile-home person, surely.'
   'Whole different ballpark of Subject. The Dickinson theory I have to admit came from these conversations.'
   'Sounds like one deep lady.'
   'Whole levels and dimensions to this one. We've had a whole series of very intense verbal interchanges. Transcendentalist poetics was just one
of the in-depth issues ranged over. This subject keeps me on the cerebral toes.'
   'Dickinson's about as Transcendentalist as Poe. Your Subject's 0 for 2.'
   'This is all off to the side of the call. I told this Subject I'd consider certain issues very carefully before I really responded.'
   'Which meant you'd consider what she wanted to hear and how to ladle it on until she begs you to have intercourse with her.'
   'I hence need considered-sounding responses to two basic questions.'
   'Why this sick thing of making me complicit in these Strategic pursuits when you know I think they're troubled and sick? It's like asking
somebody to help you culture anthrax or something.'
   'Just two questions is all.'
   'Now I'm beginning almost to be able to feel my pulse in the tooth, it feels like the infection's gathering force so fast.'
   'Firstly, what does the following word I can't find in the dictionary mean: s-a-m-i-z-d-a-t.'
   'Samizdat. Russian compound noun. Soviet twentieth-century idiom. Sam -- stem: "self"; izdat -- undeclined verb: "to publish." I think the literal
denotation's technically archaic: the sub-rosa dissemination of politically charged materials that were banned when the Eschaton-era Kremlin was
going around banning things. Connotatively, the generic meaning now is any sort of politically underground or beyond-the-pale press or the stuff
published thereby. There's no real samizdat in the U.S. per se, First Amendment-wise, I don't think. I suppose ultra-radical Québecois and Albertan
stuff could be considered O.N.A.N.ite samizdat.'
   Tow.'
   'Not just Séparatisteur pamphlets, now. It'd have to be more incendiary. Materials advocating violence, destruction of property, disruption of
Grids, anti-O.N.A.N. terrorism and so on. I don't think O.N.A.N.'s got technical bans per se, I don't think, but Poutrincourt said the R.C.M.P.s are
empowered to impound literature and even desktop-publishing and InterLink hardware et cetera without any sort of warrant.'
   'R.C.M.P.'
   'Mounties, O.'
   'The Nelson Eddy guys in silly hats and equestrian jaspers.'
   'Close enough. Next question.'
   'So you'd have no idea why The Mad Stork's name would come up in connection with somebody saying samizdat.'
   'This is the second question?'
   'Call it l(a).'
   'Not in any strict sense of the term. I guess I could see some Séparatisteurs trying to read The ONANtiad or Brick as anti-Reconfiguration films.
Maybe stuff like Poultry in Motion. A lot of Himself's stuff was self-distributed, too. And Immanent Domain's allegedly on one level an allegory about
the Concavity, though that overlooks that Gentle wasn't even President when the thing came out. But you can tell your Subject that Himself's work
was all very self-consciously American. His interest in politics was subordinate to form. Always. And none of it's banned. Whatever's still on the
InterLace back-menus is inter-Grid: you can order The ONANtiad in Manitoba, Vera Cruz, anywhere.'
   'Speaking of Quebec Separatism, interestingly.'
   'Why do I get a sinking feeling this is going to be l(a)-point-one or something. Maybe I could call you back tomorrow and we could chat on and
on. I'm going to be here reading for Boards till the Eschaton at 1400. Holiday tolls are low.'
   'It's my nickel, here.'
   'Or maybe you could simply call the person who's really the person to chat with about all issues Canadian, O.'
   'Droll.'
   'Moving right along to question 2, then -- my Epsom salts are getting cold.'
   'The big one is what you'd have to say if some tough-minded and spectacular Subject asked you what you have to say about the way every Nuck
Séparatisteur up there, from the Bloc Québecois and Fils de Montcalm all the way out to the really bug-eyed radical fringe-type sects and terroristic
cells --'
   'I'm going to have to object to the word Nuck, O.'

    'Beg pardon. The issue being why the whole Québec-Séparatisteur collection up there dropped the original Quebec-independence objective like a
rock and switched seemingly overnight to putting everything into agitating against O.N.A.N. and the Reconfiguration and forcing the return of the
Concavity to our map.'
    'O., this is O.N.A.N.ite politics. I'd look my Subject right in the big blue eye and tell her straight-out that the field of nanomicroscopy is not yet
advanced enough to measure my interest in the intricacies of O.N.A.N.ite politics. Poutrincourt's class is disquieting enough. The whole thing's
unpleasant and dry and repetitive and mostly dull. Thevet has a kind of compelling romanto-historical yarn to spin, though, about --'
    Tm serious. You've had some background, at least. The only Nuck prorector we ever got taught ceramics.'
    'But you're the one with the Pleiades and the 5 on the French Achievement boards and the ability to trill your R's.'
    'That's Parisian. And now I don't even watch the sports summaries, much less the political stuff. Just try for just one second. This Subject raised
issues that were way out of my depth.'
    'That's not even coherent enough to be a mixed metaphor, O. Are you honestly telling me you want your depth increased? Or are you just
looking for some Cliff-Note summary so you can incorporate the impression of depth into some new panty-removal campaign? Are you going to tell
her you studied O.N.A.N.ite politics under the Jesuits?'
    'The whole thing was dicey. I had to tell the Subject that I had to think about it and ponder, that I always took time to ponder at depth before I
just dashed off an opinion.'
    'And don't tell me: this is your Moment profiler? Your Boswell in an E cup? Is this why she's en route? Was the whole familio-historical profile
story last week a dodge? Am I really just supposed to sit down with her and paint you now as a political-minded ex-seminarian who's married to
someone only some sort of heroically proportioned goddess could tempt you to betray? Because I'll tell you right now that Schtitt's not going to let
any of us here talk to anybody from some glossy rag like Moment without him or deLint sitting right there with us. Gone are the days of Himself not
caring how many who's-the-next-Venus-Williams-hype journalists haunt the grounds, man. Schtitt's now calling the shots on who talks to whom.
DeLint has a whole scathing appendix to the Admissions Manual about junior development and toxic hype.'
    'Helen'll be able to get in.'
    'Schtitt's not going to let me hype your political acuity or pseudo-wife or anything else. He's got C.T. seeing this place as a sort of prophylactic
against commercial attention. He thinks junior commercial attention's deforming. The Manual now invites us to see ourselves as in utero and hype
as thalidomide. Schtitt'll let her in and stick her in with C.T. and let C.T. filibuster her till she throws herself out the window like that journalist from
Condé Nast last fall.'
    'Forget the profile. Speak to her or don't. This is personal.'
    'Meaning you've discovered she has small children and maybe a marriage you can deform.'
    'I'm ignoring all this. Helen's a different sort of Subject. I've discovered levels and dimensions to Helen that have nothing to do with profiles.'
    'Meaning she's a tough nut. Meaning you've set your crosshairs and she hasn't succumbed. And she knows you're not married and not a
tormented Jesuit. She's Strategy-resistant because she knows too much to fall for a persona.'
    'Co-ponder with me a second, if you're through. Stop me at any time. Jump right in at any time. On both the ultra-left and -right, the brass ring
up there has always been independent secession for Quebec, historically, no? Am I off? The Fronte Liberation and so on? The Fils de Montcalm. Or
is it maybe du? Are they the ones in Spandex and pancake makeup? The giant pies dropped on Ottawa after the third Meech Lake Accord?'
    'Parizeau et all and so on. Feel free to stop me or jump in. It all'd been about getting Quebec out of Canada, right? The Meech Lake and
Charlottetown revolts. The Crétien assassination. "Notre Rai Pays." Terrorists in plaid flannel. French Canada for the Fran-cophonic. Acadian
Zionism. "La Québecois Toujours." "On ne parle d'Anglais ici." `
    'With all the terrorism especially directed at Ottawa, pressure on Ottawa and Canada. "Permettez Nous Partir, Permettez Nous Être." Or we blow
up the Frontenac. Or we irradiate Winnipeg. Or we put a railroad-spike through Crétien's eye. This is not exactly deep-depth, O.'
    'Yes and then but suddenly everything changes when Ottawa, under duress or no, puts itself under the surgically sterile like thumb of O.N.A.N.,
with the advent of O.N.A.N., Gentle, quote unquote Experialism.'
    'You don't sound like you need any input from me on all this, O.'
    'But so but then in immediate unison all the various different Separatist groups drop secession and independence like rocks and all transfer their
insurgent resentment to O.N.A.N. and the U.S., and now insurge against O.N.A.N. on behalf of the same Canada they'd spent decades treating like
the enemy. Does this seem a little bit odd?'
    t         5
    'Doesn't this seem a little odd, Hallie?'
    'I'm really the wrong blood-relative to ask about the intricacies of the Canadian radical mind, O. We have a blood-relative who's got dual
citizenship, if you recall. Who I'm sure'd be overjoyed to ponder Separatist ideological flux with you all you want and then some. I'm sure. Once her
jaw recovered from being unhinged by joy that you actually called.'
    'I'm slapping not one but both knees at the dro--'
    ' 'd you know she's never once asked me whether Booboo and I hear from you? Not once. A sort of appalled pride. She's ashamed of even
hurting over it, some --'
    'Kidding all off to the side, I'm serious about this. The oddness of it. You know I respect your frontal lobes, Hallie. I'm asking for depth, not any
kind of expertise.'
    'You just ignored the meat of everything I just said. You're like an old person about this. With an old person's weird selective hearing.'
    'I'm going to let this whole pot-insulting-the-kettle on selective awareness of things just slide right on by. As a gesture that this is a serious call.
Why they all seemingly with one mind switched objectives.'
    'And acting on behalf of the whole of Canada, Quebec, suddenly, is what you want explained. Or do you simply want it confirmed as odd?'
    'The Subject cited polls from when they were still bothering to take polls up there that said like upwards of four-fifths of all Canadians wanted
out of O.N.A.N. and hoped President Gentle had a ghastly accident in his UV-booth, et cetera.'
    'So the second and final question concerns this shift from anti-Canadian Québecer nationalism to anti-O.N.A.N. Canadian nationalism.'
    'What I was thinking is is this maybe a textbook case of Johnny-Gentle-type-find-an-enemy-for-a-divided-nation-to-come-together-by-blaming-
and-hating theory in action? Is this somehow Quebec like circling its wagons with Alberta and all the other provinces in the face of a common
enemy?'
        '...'
   'Hal?'
   'You could always point out to the profiler that there's a nice little irony to Gentle's strategy ending up bringing Canada together at our expense,
when it was pretty obviously meant to bring us together at Canada's expense.'
   'But you sound like you think the more deeply pondered response would be something else.'
   'All I know is some very basic schoolboy history from Poutrincourt's class. And from the advantage of occasional contact with the Moms.'
   'Hit me.'
   'The historical record indicates pretty clearly that the one and only nationalism in the Québecois soul is Québecois nationalism. It's been "Nous v.
La Plupart Toujours," and the more so the farther out on the fringes you get. I can't see the Séparatisteurs considering Quebec a true part of
Canada any more than Lesotho saw itself as part of SOUTHAF. Poutrincourt keeps thumping the fact that there's no valid comparison between
Quebec and our own antebellum South. Why do you think Meech Lake IIIh failed? It's because at root they've never seen themselves as anything
other than hostages of Ottawa and the Anglophone provinces. Even moderate Séparatisteurs like Parizeau spoke of the final surrender on the Plains
of Abraham as a kind of forced property-transfer, the whole original war1 as one in which French-Canadians weren't the losers so much as the
spoils. Booty.'
   'This all checks with the Subject's take.'
   'The impression I get is that Quebec's hatred of anglophone Canada transcends anything they could work up against O.N.A.N. Just mention 1759
and the Moms's lips disappear. Pemulis and Axford keep coming early and putting a big gothic 1759 on the blackboard before GÔcMJ just to watch
the Moms's lips disappear when she comes in and sees it.'
   'My sense is the Subject concurs on the hatred-assessment. They want plain out, always have. Health-care and NAFTA be damned. That's why
they sabotaged all three Meech Lake Accords, she says. She seems to imply the anti-O.N.A.N. thing is some sort of anomalous dodge or
something.'
   'I've got to confess a sort of curiosity now about this profiler you just last week were preparing to fend off about Himself. Not to mention
comparing her to defensive linemen. Rubensian was never your type, I didn't think.'
        '...'
   'Plus any Subject you're bothering about even giving the impression of depth to. This is more work than your type of Subject tends to demand,
usually, isn't it?'
  '...'
   'This is something else that isn't you. You've never exactly been shy about discussing Subjects with me.'
   'It's complex. She's grown on me.'
   'It's this certain way she takes notes on your explanation of Coffin-Corner punts.'
   'It's complicated. There's a lot I'm not saying. She's got levels. I've discovered levels and dimensions to her I didn't know were originally there.'
   'Oh O., please don't let it just be you've just discovered she's married with little kids.
   That's not it by any chance is it? Please let it be something other than little kids.'
   '...'
   'Let it be something other than the hordes of other Subjects I've sat and listened to excruciatingly detailed sadistic blow-by-blow Strategic
accounts of. Orin "Home-wrecker" Incandenza, this is what the team calls you, in like jest? You sick pup.'
   'I'm a sick pup? I'm the sick one?'
   '... Wants to blame her, won't admit it, needs to, won't admit it, sweepingly blames the whole affair of Himself on her, won't interface with her or
worse even acknowledge her, resents even the fact she forgives things like you and Marlon Bain killing her dog --'
   '-- a hit-and-run-and-back-up-and-hit-again driver, I told you rep--'
   '-- pretends he gets the most retardate PR staffer he can make hold the crayon to send grotesque solecistic pseudo-impersonal replies to her
pathetic letters. Jethro Bodine, O.? Jethro Bodine?
   'A private chuckle. She'd never get it.'
   'Disowns her -- worse, sicker, tells himself he's convinced himself she doesn't even exist, as if she never existed, but by some coincidence has
this rapacious fetish for young married mothers he can strategize into betraying their spouses and maybe damaging their kids for all time, and has
this apparently even more rapacious compulsive need to call the blood-relative he hasn't even seen in four years and tell him all about every
Subject and Strategy, blow-by-blow, long distance, in nanomicroscopic detail. Let's stop and ponder this all for a moment, O., what say?'
   'I'm letting all this be just water off a duck's back. I can tell it's the tooth talking. I can remember the stress of the place. All I can say is that
trust me here: this Moment Subject is like strickenly dissimilar from what you're indicting. The levels and circumstances aren't the ones you're so
anxious to call rapacious. Is all I can say at this juncture.'
   'Why do I suspect it's simply that you tried to make the big X with her and she demurred and this simply piqued your interest? During my can't-
miss nail-interval you were saying how enormous interior linemen were making comments about her bottom being so huge and soft you could
whack it over and over with a car antenna and not hurt it.'
   'Hallie I never said any such fucking thing. You pulled that out of the air. And I'm sick?'
   'You said she was obese.'
   'I said she was a girl and a half in all directions. Which all of a sudden there was something that seemed cross-cultural about it: I had this
sudden flash of understanding how cultures can regard largeness as erotic. More of someone to love. Not to mention queerly and oddly intense and
alive and vibrant.'
   'And she declined a casual advance, and showed you pictures of her like enormous offspring, and you came to attention.'
   'With a heartbreakingly lovely face, too, Hal, all peachy and lissome, like big pretty girls get.'
   Tm going to have to keep her away from this kid Ortho Stice up here, because he really is a Rubensophile. After P.M.s when we sit around he'll
go on and on about enormous breasts and melon bellies and quivering laps until we're all grimacing and pinching our nose-bridges. And whatever
you meant was not lissome.'
   'The reserve QB who's next to me in these godawful pre-game costumed swoop-and-glides said something I liked. Helen passed him in the
locker room and he -- do you want to hear this?'
   'She was in the locker room?'
   'It's the law. The pros aren't a PR-gulag. He said she had a face that'd break your heart and then also break the heart of whoever like rushed
over to your aid as you pitched over sideways grabbing your chest.'
   'That is a pretty good one, O.'
   'But so far we concur on the basic oddness, it sounds like. If the radicals want Quebec loose from Canada still, and that's always been the
priceless pearl, why like dissipate themselves trying to wreak mayhem down here almost the precise moment Interdependence is declared? 'ce
pas?'
   'I'd rather just agree it's a stumper and then go dry my ankle and find a clean shirt and grab Schacht and hit him up for some Anbesol before we
hit the truck.'
   'Right? And do these different groups get along, amongst themselves, the different Separatist flanges?'
   'Not according to Poutrincourt they don't.'
   'So why then the united concerted switch from like Let Quebec Go or we stick knives in the eyes of Canadian VIPs and drop huge confections on
Rue Sherbrooke during St. Jean-Baptiste Day to all of a sudden Let Canada Go or we blow up ATHSCME towers and stretch mirrors across U.S.
highways and hang fleur-de-lis banners from U.S. monuments and disrupt InterLace pulses and skywrite Nuck obscenities over Buffalo and dicky
with waste-vehicle launchers so it rains moose-guano on New Haven and shoot O.N.A.N.ite V.I.P.s on U.S. soil and only barely get foiled from
injecting anaerobic toxins into jars of Planters peanuts?'
   'The New Haven Brown Rain thing was sort of a chortle, though, you have to admit.'
   'Chortles are good. We like chortles. But what's the political motivation for the about-face? Account for this for me. All it has to do is sound
soberly considered.'
   'Orin, I'm trying to reconcile your doubtless sincere seriousness about this with your choice of me as co-ponderer.'
   'All--'
   Tm a privileged white seventeen-year-old U.S. male. I'm a student at a tennis academy that sees itself as a prophylactic. I eat, sleep, evacuate,
highlight things with yellow markers, and hit balls. I lift things and swing things and run in huge outdoor circles. I am just about as apolitical as
someone can be. I am out of all loops but one, by design. I'm sitting here naked with my foot in a bucket. What exactly is it you hope to get from
me on this? I keep losing focus on whether you want a deep-sounding line of patter to facilitate Xing this fleshy Subject or have somehow been
seduced into believing it's really worth pondering the weedy thought-processes of fringe Canadians. Of fringe anybody. How consistent do the
Brazilian Nuevo Contras' objectives look? The Noie Störkraffs? Shining Path's? The Belgian CCCY? Pro-Life assault squads? The Ez-ed-Dean-el-
Qassan? P.E.T.A. fur-farm arsonists' objectives? Jesus, Gentle and the poor C.U.S.P.s?'k
   'Poor C.U.S.P.s?'
   'Why not just soberly shrug and invoke the term wacko and leave it at that? Why not tell her you're a radically simple and somewhat sick young
man who kicks balls really high in the air for a living?'
   'All I--'
   'Why not just say who cares? This stuff isn't about you and me. The person this stuff is about is the person you say you've erased from all RAM.
Why not tell the damn truth for once?'
   'Me tell the truth? Me lie?'
   'What, this ascapartic bathroom-mag journalist is going to give you like an SAT entrance-test on Francophone extremism? Like a gyno-entrance
exam? You have to place above a certain percentile to get her to let you X her on the floor of the nursery right next to the bassinet? Whom are you
trying to kid? Whom do you think this is really about? Can you be that sick that you can't even admit it over the fucking phone?'
   'Or what?'
   'I'm sorry, O. I apologize.'
   'Think nothing of it. I know you didn't mean it.'
   'I hate losing the temper.'
   'You don't sound good, Hallie. You sound ground down.'
   Hal grinds at his eye with a finger. 'These tooth-episodes make me feel like that wobbled shrieking figure in that Munch lithograph.'
   'That chew's going to eat right through your membranes. It's a vicious vice. I'm urging in all earnest. Ask that Schacht kid.'
   Michael Pemulis cracks Hal's door slowly and slowly pokes his head and one shoulder in, saying nothing. He has showered but is still flushed, and
his right eye gets wobbly in this certain way when two or three Tenuates are wearing off. He has his yachting cap, gold epaulets of fake naval
braid, and in one ear a piratical gold hoop that lights up in sync with his pulse. With the door just cracked and his head poked in he brings his other
arm in over from behind like it's not his arm, his hand in the shape of a claw just over his head, and makes as if the claw from behind is pulling him
back out into the hall. W/ an eye-rolling look of fake terror.
   Hal is hunched, examining his finger for eye-material. 'In all the excitement we've neglected the most obvious response, then, O. Your answer
for the exam, and then I can go dry the ankle.' He can hear PemuJis asking Petropolis Kahn and Stephan Wagenknecht something off down the
hall through the cracked door.
   'I think I already tried the obvious response on her, but hit me.'
   'Pemulis just made his first pass and left the door ajar. I'm sitting here nude in a draft through an open door neglecting the maybe deceptively
obvious fact that something like, what, three-quarters of the Concavity's northern border runs contiguous to Quebec.'
   'Exactamundo.'
   'So that so what if Ottawa didn't formally subjoin the Concavity to any particular province. Really big favor, I'm sure. Because the map speaks for
itself. Bits of western New Brunswick and a smidgeon of Ontario aside, the Concavity -- the physical fact and fallout of the Concavity -- it's
Quebec's problem. Something like 750 clicks of border along the Concavity, with attendant seepage, for Notre Rai Pays.'
   'Yes plus the brunt of the airborne wastes from the high-altitude ATHSCMEs, plus being the province that gets splatted when the E.W.D. vehicles
overshoot the Concavity. This is what í tried right off the bat on her.'
   'So what's the puzzle. Put yourself in Quebec's shoes. Once again they get the gooey end of the Canadian dipstick. It's mostly now western
Québecer kids the size of Volkswagens shlumpfing around with no skulls. It's Québecers with cloracne and tremors and olfactory hallucinations and
infants born with just one eye in the middle of their forehead. It's eastern Quebec that gets green sunsets and indigo rivers and grotesquely
asymmetrical snow-crystals and front lawns they have to beat back with a machete to get to their driveways. They get the feral-hamster incursions
and the Infant-depredations and the corrosive fogs.'
   'Although people aren't exactly flocking to New Brunswick or Lake Ontario either. And the coastal ATHSCMEs send the coastal phenols out over
Fundy, and supposedly the lobsters out there are like monsters in old Japanese films, and supposedly Nova Scotia glows, at night, in satellite
photos.'
   'Still and all, O., tell her proportionally speaking it's Quebec that's borne the brunt of what Canada had to take. The brunt again, to their way of
thinking, remember. Small wonder the fringe mentalities are violently anti-O.N.A.N. up there. There's got to be a real straw-and-camel feel to the
whole thing.'
   The door swings all the way open and clunks against the wall behind it. Michael Pemulis has pretended to kick it in. 'Good Lard preserve us he's
nekkid,' he says, coming in and closing the door to check behind it. Hal holds up a hand for him to wait a second.
   'Except here's the thing,' Orin says. Pemulis stands expectantly in an uncluttered patch of Hal's half of the floor and makes a show of looking at
his wrist as if there were a watch there. Hal nods at him and holds up one finger.
   'Except here's the thing,' Orin is saying. 'The issue she raises is is there really any sort of realistic hope of Quebec getting Gentle to get O.N.A.N.
to reverse the Reconfiguration. Take back the Concavity, shut down the fans, make us acknowledge the waste as fundamentally American waste.'
   'Well probably of course not.' Hal looks up at Pemulis and makes his own hand into a claw and makes clawing motions at the phone. Pemulis is
compulsively going around zipping and unzipping everything in the room with a zipper, a habit of his Hal loathes. 'But now she's got you falling
back into demanding realistic and consistent logic from fringe mentalities again.'
   'But Hallie just hang on. Canada as a whole couldn't oppose O.N.A.N. Wouldn't. Ottawa's so far in now they wouldn't say shit if they had three
times the mouthful they already have. Of shit I mean.'
   Pemulis is pointing vehemently out the west window at the parking lot where the tow truck is parked and making exaggerated Henry Vlll-like
rending and chewing motions. His eyes, under the waning influence of P.M. stimulants, do not get mirthful or glazed.
   They just get tiny and lightless and even closer together in his narrow face, like a second set of nostrils. The right eye's little wobble is out of
sync with the pulse of his earring.
   There's the sound of Orin switching phone-hands. 'So then I'll ask you what she seemed like she rhetorically asked: are the Separatists' and
fringe cells' pathetic little anti-O.N.A.N. campaigns and gestures down here basically just hopeless and pathetic?'
   'Does fish-shit drift slowly bottomward, O.? How could she see it as anything but, if she's as savvy as you say?' Hal removes his pruned white
foot from the janitor-bucket and dries it on a woppsed-up sheet. He points at a pair of underwear near Pemulis's Dock-sider. Pemulis picks the
briefs up off the floor with two fingers and tosses them to Hal with a pretend-shudder.
   'So simply largely symbolic at best, then?'
   Hal's lying back trying to get his legs into the briefs with one hand. 'Tell her after much chin-stroking simply yes, O. O., Pemulis is standing here
already in his hat pretending to clang a dinner bell. He's got big glittery ropes of drool swinging from his lower lip.' Pemulis is actually making a
complex system of motions indicating both the procedures for rolling a duBois and the lateness of the hour. For the past two years, Hal and
Pemulis and Struck and Troeltsch and sometimes B. Boone have made a little ritual of nipping out to the little hidden clearing behind West House's
parking lot's dumpsters and sharing an obscene cigar-sized duBois before the I.-Day-Eve expedition and supper out, while Schacht and sometimes
Ortho Stice sit inside the tow truck, faces green in the green glow of the truck's instruments, warming it up. Hal sits up and makes a waggling go-
on-ahead-on-down motion to Pemulis.
   'But you have the . .. Mr. Hope,' Pemulis stage-whispers.
   'One moment please.' Hal clamps a hand hard over the phone and covers phone and hand with two pillows and some bedding, and stage-
whispers 'Where's your part of the Mr. H. all of a sudden? Why do we have to roll a zeppelin out of my part of the Hope I bought retail from you
not three days ago?'
   The nystagmus makes the eye-rolling lurider. 'Extenuations. We can get it all sorted out right later. Nobody's going to like exploit you.'
   And then it's hard to extract the hand and phone. 'O., I'm going to have to book out of here in just about one second.'
   'Just how about this. Ponder this in advance for me and try and stay upright til you can call me back. This was the Subject's crux-type proposal.
You can call collect if you want.'
   'I don't have to respond,' Hal says.
   'Correct.'
   'I just listen and then break the connection.'
   'Calling me like tonight or tomorrow before lunch, collect if I.-Day's full-toll.'
   'I just sit here very briefly and then the conversation's over and we can go.' Hal's directing all this more at Pemulis, who's pacing and holding the
Constantine bust in his hands and examining it at close range, shaking his head.
   'All set? This is it. Are you set?'
   'So go already.'
   'Her poser goes roughly like this. If the Separatists' big object has always been to independently secede, and if they've got about a snowball's
chance of ever really getting O.N.A.N. de-Reconfigured, and if pretty much all Canadians despise Gentle and the transfer of the Concavity and the
whole Experialist merde sandwich, but especially the Concavity, the cartographic fact of a Concavity in our map and a new Convexity in theirs, that
the maps now say it's Canadian soil, this toxified like area: grant that all this is obviously right; then why don't the Separatists in Quebec use the
fact of the odiousness of the Concavity to go put their parliamentary wigs on and go to Ottawa to parliament and say to the rest of Canada like:
Look, let us secede, and we'll take the Concavity with us when we secede, it'll be our problem not yours, it'll go on the maps as Québecois and not
Canadian, it'll be our blot and our bone of dissension with O.N.A.N., and Canadian honor will be desmirched, and Canada's pathetic standing in
O.N.A.N. and the like world community of standings will be rehabilitated because of the ingenious way Ottawa's parliament will have re-
gerrymandered O.N.A.N.'s map without taking on the U.S. directly? Why not this? Why don't they go to Ottawa and say Cuibono all around and say
This way everybody wins? We get our own Notre Rai Pays, and you get the slap in the face of the Concavity off your map. The Subject posited why
the Nucks don't see the odiousness of the Concavity as maybe the best thing that ever happened to them in terms of Canada's persuadability into
letting Quebec go. She hit me with Why wouldn't your thinking militant Nucks use the Concavity as a bargaining chip for independence, why would
they want O.N.A.N. to take back the one thing odious enough to be a chip?'
   'Who's this you're talking to you can't call back?' Pemulis says loudly, pacing back and forth with little toy-soldier about-faces, his hoop flickering
like mad.
   Hal lowers the phone but doesn't cover it. 'It's Orin, wanting to know why Quebec and the F.L.Q. and so on haven't tried bargaining with the
Canadian administration, offering Quebec's cartographic adoption of the Concavity in exchange for Separation.' Hal cocks his head slightly. 'This
could be Poutrincourt's so-called Separation and return's real meaning, it occurs to me.'
   'Orin as in your brother, with the leg?'
   'He's all in a swivet about inter-O.N.A.N.ite politics.'
   Pemulis makes a megaphone of his hands. 'Tell him who gives a bright flaming fart! Tell him to go read a book! Tell him to access any one of a
dozen D-bases off of the Net! Tell him you're pretty sure he can afford it!' Pemulis's hands are slender and red-knuckled and his fingers long and
sort of falcate. 'Tell him you can hear the truck getting impatiently revved as on one of the very few totally free nights we ever get our friends get
ready to leave without you. Remind him how we have to eat on schedule up here or we get the wobbles. Tell him we read books and tirelessly
access D-bases and run our asses off all day here and need to eat instead of we don't just stand there and swing one leg up and down over and
over for seven-plus figures.'
   'Tell Penisless to go sit on something sharp,' Orin says.
   'O., he's right, I can feel that feeling of my body starting to feed on itself. You said I could think and call you back. I'll use your pager if you like.'
   Pemulis has used one foot to clear a path through laundry and diskettes and books and gear to the west window, where he's making broad
involved gestures with a person or persons outside down on the grounds whom the window's big sill keeps Hal from being able to see. Hal's
underwear is at a diagonal across his pelvis. Orin on the phone is saying:
   'Picture this and see what you think. Imagine this. The F.L.Q. and other various Separatist cells all suddenly divert their terror's energies away
from Canada and suddenly start mounting an insurgent campaign of U.S. and Mexican harassment. But the thing is they make a big deal of
terroristically insurging against O.N.A.N. on the behalf of all of Canada. They even find a way to bring the Albertan ultra-rightists in on it, plus other
provincial fringes, so it looks to O.N.A.N. like maybe all of Canada as a whole is in on the insurging.'
   'I don't have to picture it. It's what's going on. The C.P.C.P.1 makes incursions against Montana like clockwork. There was that horrific jamming
of InterLace pulses and substitution of porn-films for children's programming around Duluth in June traced to that psycho quintet in southwest
Ontario. The Interstates north of Saratoga are still supposed to be undrivable after sunset.'
   'Exactly.'
   'So some point for me to ponder needs to emerge really fast, here, Orin.'
   'The point is I was rhetorically invited by the Subject to entertain the picture of it all really being the Nucks. The pan-Canadian thing being a
dodge. The Separatists all somehow united and orchestrating the anti-O.N.A.N.ism. The rhetorical question becomes to imagine this and ask: Why
would they do this?'
   'We're wearing a groove in the same track again, O. It's because the Concavity impacts mainly Quebec.'
   'No, I mean she meant why would they make such a noise about insurging on behalf of all of Canada and go to such lengths to orchestrate the
appearance of pan-Canadian anti-O.N.A.N.ism.'
   'And then judging by precedent the Subject gave a hypothetical answer to her own question. Have you gotten to get a word in edgewise
throughout this series of interviews, O.?'
   'What if it's that the Nuck Separatists know totally well that if the O.N.A.N. administration sees Canada as a big enough roach in the ointment,
Gentle and Unspecified Services' boys in white can get together with Mexico's Vichified puppet-state and make things like really unpleasant indeed
for Ottawa. They could make Canada the sort of black scapegoat of all of O.N.A.N. There's little you can picture that might be worse than being the
one country in a three-country continental Anschluss that the other two countries are ganging up on and making things unpleasant for.'
   'Vichified Anschluss? This doesn't sound like any Orin I know. These are rabidly political catchwords. What kind of heartbreaking Rubensian
Moment-type fluff-journalist is this you're so determined to --?'
   'The unpleasantness is pretty easy to imagine a picture of. The E.W.D. vectors could easily be recalibrated further north, Gentle could tell them.
Our waste-resources are extensive. At the mildest, he could say, good-sized chunks of Canada could be Concav-itized.'
   'I have to go. Pemulis is slumped back against the wall with his hands over his stomach and is slumping all the way down the wall looking
wobbly and pale.'
   'Ponder the picture of the parliament's nails bitten all the way down to the ragged pink pulpy stuff as the Nucks orchestrate the terrorism so it
looks more and more like Canada versus O.N.A.N.'
   Hal's in slacks and one street-sock and one athletic sock and picking different shirts up off the floor, trying to smell a clean one. 'But this is all --'
   'Kyaaaa!' Pemulis vaults a corner of Hal's bed and tries to claw at the transparent phone's antenna like he's going to break it off. Hal turns to
protect the phone with a shoulder, whipping at Pemulis with a sweatshirt.
   Orin is saying 'What I'm asking is for you to ponder could it maybe end up that Quebec, after wreaking various mayhi down here and making it
look like it's all of Canada, the P.Q.s or somebody respectable gets wigged up and go to Ottawa and offers this deal: Parliament gets the P.M. and
the government to get the other provinces to let Quebec go, Separate, aller, partir -- and in return Québec'll step up the anti-O.N.A.N. harassment
and insurgency while dropping the pretense of other provinces being involved and all of Canada insurging and make it publicly clear that it's
Quebec and Quebec alone that's O.N.A.N.'s real nemesis. They tell Ottawa they'll offer the contiguousness of the Concavity as their reason and
send absolutely everything they've got in terms of terrorism at O.N.A.N. and Gentle, taking full credit each time. Offering themselves as the culprit
and de-Reconfiguration as the objective.'
   'So your multilevelled journalist's hypothesizing a kind of meta-extortion.' Hal can hear Pemulis's whistle-lipped breathing. 'Separation is still the
Québecer insurgents' real goal, and their anti-O.N.A.N. insurgency is not what it appears.' Hal's in the dark under the desk that the fold-out TP and
drives and phone console and modem are stacked on one corner of, surrounded by nests of wires, trying to find his other street-shoe. 'It's
supposedly just been a ruse to arouse O.N.A.N.'s ire at Canada so the Québecers can use the U.S. and Mexico as levers on Ottawa.'
   'Trying to engineer it so that Canada'll be more than happy to disassociate from them,'

   Orin says. 'And Fm saying I don't have the background or lobes to even know whether she might be putting me on, testing my depth.'
   'You've always had a special dread of depth-testing.'
   'How about why don't you just toss me the Bob and Axhandle and me'll go down and get things ready and wait for you,' Pemulis stage-whispers
to Hal's slacks' bottom, which is pretty much all that's visible from under the desk. Hal's hand comes up out of the leg-space under the desk and
raises one finger and shakes it a little for emphasis. Pemulis is standing next to the small TP viewer -- which is propped up like a large photo with a
buttressy thing that folds out of its back -- and the TP's disk- and cartridge-drive, which takes up less than a quarter of the desktop and has the
phone's console and power unit bolted into a receptacle on the drive's side.
   Hal's voice is muffled and has the strained pitch of someone trying to clear nests of dust-bunnied wire to find something. 'Except Orin I don't see
a great deal of pondering required here. The total anti-U.S. insurgency so far's been too hapless and small-potato for her theory to work. The odd
pie- and guano-bombardment, stretching mirrors across lonely roads, even demapping officials and botulizing the occasional peanut jar. None of
this is exactly bringing anyone to his knees. None of this is making Canada or Quebec look like any kind of serious threat.'
   Michael Pemulis, his jaunty cap pushed back and his lips pursed as if whistling, but not whistling, is very casually brushing his hand over the
drive and console's power unit, as if killing time by casually dusting. His other hand's jingling pocket-change. There's the sound of Hal clunking his
head on something under the desk. His bottom is bony and his belt has missed two loops. The power unit's toggle's next to a little red jewel of a
power-light that blinks at the same rate as a smoke alarm when the toggle's on ON.
   Hal sneezes twice. Pemulis taps his fingers in a little anapestic gallop over the unit's top. Orin sounds like he's sitting up straight. 'Hallie kid now
you're right with me, this is where your pondering lobes come in, because that was just my response, that there was nothing sufficiently more than
just an annoying gnat-like annoyance about the insurgencies, which is where she moved beyond my depth back into l(a), if you remember, when
she raised this samizdat-word in connec--'

particularly the variations on the medical root brady, from the Greek bradys meaning slow, such as bradylexia (w/r/t reading), bradyphenia
(practical-problem-solving-type thinking), nocturnal bradypnea (dangerously slow breathing during sleep sometimes, which is why Mario uses four
pillows minimum), bradypedestrianism (obvious), and especially bradykinesia, an almost gerontologic lentissimo about most of Mario's movements,
an exaggerated slowness that both resembles and permits extremely close slow attention to whatever's being done.

     You'd somehow think that Mario would be thick as thieves with the blue-collar custodial and kitchen and physical plant/grounds staff, but it's
odd, he and they never have much to say to each other, and with rare exceptions none of the E.T.A.s including Mario has anything interpersonal to
do with the nine-month part-time halfway-house rehabilitating workers, who mostly mow and mop and empty trash and load dishes into the dining

open up and submit to scrutiny, which Schacht can well imagine would hurt his feelings: nobody wants to be an object of clinical interest like that.

        Pemulis here, dictating to Inc, who can just sit there making a steeple out of his fingers and pressing it to his lip and not take notes and wait
and like inscribe [sic] it anytime in the next week and get it verbatim, the smug turd. Using the Mean-Value formula for dividing available
megatonnage among Combatants whose GNP/Military // Military/Nuke ratios vary from Eschaton to Eschaton keeps you from needing to crunch out
a new ratio for each Combatant each time, plus lets you multi-regress the results so Combatants get rewarded for past thermonuclear largesse
[occasional verbal flourishes Hal's -- HJI]. The formula's also provable by the Extreme Value Theorem, which the EV Theorem itself has a proof
that's just about the biggest Unit-twisting bitch in the whole of applied differentiation, but I see Hal grimacing, so we'll keep it compact, even
though this whole thing is real interesting if you're interested and whatnot.
    Say you've got a Combatant and a record of his past GNP/Military // Military/Nuke ratios. We want to give the Combatant the like exact average
of all the past megatonnages he's gotten in the past. The exact average is called the 'Mean Value,' which ought to give us a bit of a giggle, given
the hostility of the context here.
    So then but let A stand for the Mean Value of a Combatant's constantly fluctuating ratio and so constantly fluctuating initial megatonnage. We
want to find A and give the Combatant exactly A megatons. How to do it's pretty elegant, and all you need for it is two pieces of data: the most his
ratio's ever been and the least it's ever been. These two datums [sic] are called the Extreme Values of the cn-n function for which A's the Mean
Value, by the way.
    So then but so let / be a continuous non-negative function (meaning the ratio) on the interval [a, b] (meaning the difference between the least
the ratio's ever been and the most it's ever been and whatnot). Are these little explanations aggravating [sic]? Inc's looking at me like butter would
freeze. It's hard to know what to assume v. what to explain. I'm trying to be as clear as I can be [sic]. And now he's looking at me like I'm
digressing. Why don't you just pass that certain item back on over here, Inculator. But so we've got / and we've got [a, bj. And let r and R be the
smallest and biggest values of the function /(x) on the interval [a, b]. So now check out the rectangles of height r and height R over the interval [a,
b] in the diagram marked let's go ahead and mark it say PEEMSTER:
