      I am coming to see that the sensation of the worst nightmares, a sensation that can be felt asleep or awake, is identical to those
worst dreams' form itself: the sudden intra-dream realization that the nightmares' very essence and center has been with you all
along, even awake: it's just been . .. overlooked; and then that horrific interval between realizing what you've overlooked and
turning your head to look back at what's been right there all along, the whole time.... Your first nightmare away from home and
folks, your first night at the Academy, it was there all along: The dream is that you awaken from a deep sleep, wake up suddenly
damp and panicked and are overwhelmed with the sudden feeling that there is a distillation of total evil in this dark strange
subdorm room with you, that evil's essence and center is right here, in this room, right now. And is for you alone. None of the
other little boys in the room are awake; the bunk above yours sags dead, motionless; no one moves; no one else in the room feels
the presence of something radically evil; none thrash or sit damply up; no one else cries out: whatever it is is not evil for them.
The flashlight your mother name-tagged with masking tape and packed for you special pans around the institutional room: the
drop-ceiling, the gray striped mattress and bulged grid of bunksprings above you, the two other bunkbeds another matte gray that
won't return light, the piles of books and compact disks and tapes and tennis gear; your disk of white light trembling like the moon
on water as it plays over the identical bureaus, the recessions of closet and room's front door, door's frame's bolections; the cone of
light pans over fixtures, the lumpy jumbles of sleeping boys' shadows on the snuff-white walls, the two rag throw-rugs' ovals on
the hardwood floor, black lines of baseboards' reglets, the cracks in the Venetian blinds that ooze the violet nonlight of a night
with snow and just a hook of moon; the flashlight with your name in maternal cursive plays over every cm. of the walls, the
rheostats, CD, Inter-Lace poster of Tawni Kondo, phone console, desks' TPs, the face in the floor, posters of pros, the onionskin
yellow of the desklamps' shades, the ceiling-panels' patterns of pinholes, the grid of upper bunk's springs, recession of closet and
door, boys wrapped in blankets, slight crack like a creek's course in the eastward ceiling discernible now, maple reglet border at
seam of ceiling and walls north and south no floor has a face your flashlight showed but didn't no never did see its eyes' pupils set
sideways and tapered like a cat's its eyebrows' \ / and horrid toothy smile leering right at your light all the time you've been
scanning oh mother a face in the floor mother oh and your flashlight's beam stabs jaggedly back for the overlooked face misses it
overcorrects then centers on what you'd felt but had seen without seeing, just now, as you'd so carefully panned the light and
looked, a face in the floor there all the time but unfelt by all others and unseen by you until you knew just as you felt it didn't
belong and was evil: Evil.
      And then its mouth opens at your light.
      And then you wake like that, quivering like a struck drum, lying there awake and quivering, summoning courage and spit, roll
to the right just as in the dream for the nametagged flashlight on the floor by the bed just in case, lie there on your shank and side,
shining the light all over, just as in the dream. Lie there panning, looking, all ribs and elbows and dilated eyes. The awake floor is
littered with gear and dirty clothes, blond hardwood with sealed seams, two throw-rugs, the bare waxed wood shiny in the
windows' snowlight, the floor neutral, faceless, you cannot see any face in the floor, awake, lying there, faceless, blank, dilated,
playing beam over floor again and again, not sure all night forever unsure you're not missing something that's right there: you lie
there, awake and almost twelve, believing with all your might.
