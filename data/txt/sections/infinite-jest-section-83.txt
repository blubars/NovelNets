     They'd been the odd couple of libations, the muscled fitness-guru and the tall slope-shouldered optician/director, often down
there in the weight room til all hours, sitting on the towel dispenser, drinking, Lyle with his Caffeine Free Diet Coke, Incandenza
with his Wild Turkey. Mario literally standing by in case the ice bucket ran out or Himself needed moral support getting to the
urinal. Mario often fell asleep as the hour got severe, drifted in and out, slept upright and leaning forward, weight borne by his
police lock and lead receptacle.
     James Incandenza was one of those profound-personality-change drinkers who seemed quiet and centered and almost
affectless when he was sober but would move way out to one side or the other of the human emotional spectrum, when drunk, and
seem to open up in a way that was almost injudicious.
     Sometimes, libated late at night with Lyle in the newly outfitted E.T.A. weight room, Incandenza'd open up and pour his
heart's thickest chyme right out there for all to be affected and potentially scarred by. E.g. one night Mario, leaning way forward
into the police lock's support, drifted awake to the sound of his father saying that if he had to grade his marriage he'd give it a C--.
This seems injudicious in the extreme, potentially, though Mario, like Lyle, tends to take data pretty much as it comes.
     Lyle, who sometimes would start to get tipsy himself as Himself's pores began to excrete the bourbon, often brought some
Blake out, as in William Blake, during these all-night sessions, and read Incandenza Blake, but in the voices of various cartoon
characters, which Himself eventually started regarding as deep.146136
