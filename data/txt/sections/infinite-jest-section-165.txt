     Technical interviewers under Chief of Unspecified Services R. ('the G.') Tine <footnote>325</footnote> really do do this, bring a portable high-
watt lamp and plug it in and adjust its neck so the light shines down directly on the face of the interview's subject, whose homburg
and shade-affording eyebrows had been removed by polite but emphatic request. And it was this, the harsh light on her fully
exposed post-Marxist face, more than any kind of tough noir-informed grilling from R. Tine Jr. and the other technical
interviewer, that prompted M.I.T. A.B.D.-Ph.D. Molly Notkin, fresh off the N.N.Y.C. high-speed rail, seated in the Sidney
Peterson-shaped directorial chair amid dropped luggage in her co-op's darkened and lock-dickied living room, to spill her guts,
roll over, eat cheese, sing like a canary, tell everything she believed she knew: <footnote>326</footnote>
     -- Molly Notkin tells the U.S.O.U.S. operatives that her understanding of the après-garde Auteur J. O. Incandenza's lethally
entertaining Infinite Jest (V or VI) is that it features Madame Psychosis as some kind of maternal instantiation of the archetypal
figure Death, sitting naked, corporeally gorgeous, ravishing, hugely pregnant, her hideously deformed face either veiled or
blanked out by undulating computer-generated squares of color or ana-morphosized into unrecognizability as any kind of face by
the camera's apparently very strange and novel lens, sitting there nude, explaining in very simple childlike language to whomever
the film's camera represents that Death is always female, and that the female is always maternal. I.e. that the woman who kills you
is always your next life's mother. This, which Molly Notkin said didn't make too much sense to her either, when she heard it, was
the alleged substance of the Death-cosmology Madame Psychosis was supposed to deliver in a lalating monologue to the viewer,
mediated by the very special lens. She may or may not have been holding a knife during this monologue, and the film's big
technical hook (the Auteur's films always involved some sort of technical hook) involved some very unusual kind of single lens on
the Bolex H32's turret, <footnote>327</footnote> and it was unquestionably an f/x that Madame Psychosis looked pregnant, because the real Madame
Psychosis had never been visibly pregnant, Molly Notkin had seen her naked, <footnote>328</footnote> and you can always tell if a woman's ever
carried anything past the first trimester if you look at her naked. <footnote>329</footnote>
     -- Molly Notkin tells them that Madame Psychosis's own mother had killed herself in a truly ghastly way with an ordinary
kitchen garbage disposal on the evening of Thanksgiving Day in the Year of the Tucks Medicated Pad, four-odd months before
the film's Auteur himself had killed himself, also with a kitchen appliance, also ghastlyly, which she says though any Lincoln-
Kennedy-type connections between the two suicides will have to be ferreted out by the interviewers on their own, since as far as
Molly Notkin knew the two different parents didn't even know of each other's existence.
     -- That the lethal cartridge's digital Bolex H32 camera -- already a Rube-Goldbergesque amalgam of various improvements
and digital adaptations to the already modification-heavy classic Bolex HI6 Rex 5 -- a Canadian line, by the way, favored
throughout his whole career by the Auteur because its turret could accept three different C-mount lenses and adapters --
that Infinite Jest (V) or (V/)'s had been fitted with an extremely strange and extrusive kind of lens, and lay during filming on either
the floor or like a cot or bed, the camera, with Madame Psychosis as the Death- Mother figure inclined over it, parturient and
nude, talking down to it -- in both senses of the word, which from a critical perspective would introduce into the film a kind of
synesthetic double-entendre involving both the aural and visual perspectives of the subjective camera -- explaining to the camera
as audience-synecdoche that this was why mothers were so obsessively, con-sumingly, drivenly, and yet somehow narcissistically
loving of you, their kid: the mothers are trying frantically to make amends for a murder neither of you quite remember.
     -- Molly Notkin tells them she could be far more helpful and forth-comingly detailed if only they'd switch that beastly lamp
off or train it someplace else, which is a brass-faced falsehood and dismissed as such by R. Tine Jr., and so the light stays right on
Molly Notkin's glabrous unhappy face.
     -- That Madame Psychosis and the film's Auteur had not been sexually enmeshed, and for reasons beyond the fact that the
Auteur's belief in a finite world-total of available erections rendered him always either impotent or guilt-ridden. That in fact
Madame Psychosis had loved and been sexually enmeshed only with the Auteur's son, who, though Molly Notkin never
encountered him personally and Madame Psychosis had taken care never to speak ill of him, was clearly as thoroughgoing a little
rotter as one would find down through the whole white male canon of venery, moral cowardice, emotional chicanery, and rot.
     -- That Madame Psychosis had been present neither at the Auteur's suicide nor at his funeral. That she'd missed the funeral
because her passport had expired. That nor had Madame Psychosis been present at the reading of the late Auteur's will, despite the
fact that she was one of the beneficiaries. That Madame Psychosis had never mentioned the fate or present disposition of the
unreleased cartridge entitled either Infinite Jest (V) or Infinite Jest (VI), and had described it only from the perspective of the
experience of performing in it, nude, and had never seen it, but had a hard time believing it was even entertaining, let alone
lethally entertaining, and tended to believe it had represented little more than the thinly veiled cries of a man at the very terminus
of his existential tether -- the Auteur having apparently been extremely close to his own mother, in childhood -- and had no
doubt been recognized as such by the Auteur -- who though not exactly the psychic sea's steadiest keel had been in many respects
an acute reader and critic of film, and would have been able to distinguish the real filmic McCoy from pathetic cries veiled as film
no matter how wildly his nautical compass was spinning around, on its tether, and would in all probability have destroyed the
Master Print of the failed piece of art, the same way he'd reportedly destroyed the first four or five failed attempts at the same
piece, which pieces had admittedly featured actresses of lesser mystique and allure.
     -- That the Auteur's funeral had purportedly taken place in the L'Islet Province of Nouveau Quebec, the birth-province of the
Auteur's widow, featuring an interrment and not a cremation.
     -- That far be it from her to tell the U.S. Office of Unspecified Services its business, but why not simply go to J.O.I.'s widow
and verify directly the existence and location of the purported cartridge?
     -- That it seemed pretty unlikely to her, Molly Notkin, that the Auteur's widow had any connections to any anti-American
groups, cells, or movements, no matter what the files on her indiscreet youth might suggest, since from everything Molly Notkin's
heard the woman didn't have much interest in any agendas larger than her own individually neurotic agendas, even though she
came on to Madame Psychosis all sweet and solicitous. That Madame Psychosis had confessed to Molly Notkin that the widow
struck her as very possibly Death incarnate -- her constant smile the rictal smile of some kind of thanatoptic figure -- and that it
had struck Madame Psychosis as bizarre that it was she, Madame Psychosis, whom the Auteur kept casting as various feminine
instantiations of Death when he had the real thing right under his nose, and eminently photogenic to boot, the widow-to-be, appar-
ently a real restaurant-silencer-type beauty even in her late forties.
      -- That the Auteur had stopped ingesting distilled spirits as Madame Psy-chosis's personal condition for consenting to appear
in what she knew to be her but did not know to be the J.O.I.'s final film-cartridge, and that the Auteur had, apparently,
incredibly, <footnote>330</footnote> kept his side of the bargain -- possibly because he'd been so deeply moved at M.P.'s consent to appear before
the camera again even after her terrible accident and deformation and the little rotter of a son's despicable abandonment of the
relationship under the excuse of accusing Madame Psychosis of being sexually enmeshed with their -- here Molly Notkin said
that she of course had meant to say his -- father, the Auteur. And that the Auteur had apparently remained alcohol-free for the
whole next three-and-a-half months, from Xmas of the Year of the Tucks Medicated Pad to 1 April of the Year of the Trial-Size
Dove Bar, the date of his suicide.
      -- That the completely secret and hidden substance-abuse problem, the one that had now landed Madame Psychosis in an
elite private dependency-treatment facility so elite that not even M.P.'s closest friends knew where it was beyond knowing only
that it was someplace far, very far away, that the abuse-problem could have been nothing but a consequence of the terrible guilt
Madame Psychosis felt over the Auteur's suicide, and constituted a clear unconscious compulsion to punish herself with the same
sort of substance-abuse activity she had coerced the Auteur into stopping, merely substituting narcotics for Wild Turkey, which
Molly Notkin could attest was some very gnarly-tasting liquor indeed.
      -- No, that Madame Psychosis's guilt over the Auteur's felo de self had nothing to do with the purportedly lethal Infinite Jest
(V) or (VI), which as far as Madame Psychosis had determined from the filming itself was little more than an olla podrida of
depressive conceits strung together with flashy lensmanship and perspectival novelty. That, no, rather the consuming guilt had
been over the condition that the Auteur suspend the ingestion of spirits, which it turned out, M.P. had claimed in deluded
hindsight, had been all that was keeping the man's tether ravelled, the ingestion, such that without it he was unable to withstand
the psychic pressures that pushed him over the edge into what Madame Psychosis said she and the Auteur had sometimes referred
to as quote 'self-erasure.'
      -- That it did not strike her, Molly Notkin, as improbable that the special limited-edition turkey-shaped gift bottle of Wild
Turkey Blended Whiskey-brand distilled spirits with the cerise velveteen gift-ribbon around its neck with the bow tucked under its
wattles on the kitchen counter next to the microwave oven before which the Auteur's body had been found so ghastlyly inclined
had been placed there by the spouse's widow-to-be -- who may well have been enraged by the fact that the Auteur had never been
willing to give up spirits quote 'for her' but had apparently been willing to give them up quote 'for' Madame Psychosis and her
nude appearance in his final opus.
      -- That the by all reports exceptionally attractive Madame Psychosis had suffered an irreparable facial trauma on the same
Thanksgiving Day that her mother had killed herself with a kitchen-appliance, leaving her (Madame Psychosis) hideously and
improbably deformed, and that her membership in the Union of the Hideously and Improbably Deformed's 13-Step self-help
organization was no kind of metaphor or ruse.
      -- That the intolerable stresses leading to the Auteur's self-erasure had probably way less to do with film or digital art -- this
Auteur's anti-confluential approach to the medium having always struck Molly Notkin as being rather aloof and cerebrally
technical, to say nothing of naively post-Marxist in its self-congratulatory combination of anamorphic fragmentation and anti-
Picaresque <footnote>331</footnote> narrative stasis -- or with having allegedly spawned some angelic monster of audience-gratification -- anyone
with a nervous system who watched much of his oeuvre could see that fun or entertainment was pretty low on the late filmmaker's
list of priorities -- but rather much more likely to do with the fact that his widow-to-be was engaging in sexual enmeshments with
just about everything with a Y-chromo-some, and had been for what sounded like many years, including possibly with the
Auteur's son and Madame's craven lover, as a child, seeing as it sounded like the little rotter had enough malcathected issues with
his mother to keep all of Vienna humming briskly for quite some time.
      -- That thus -- with the Promethean-guilt angle on the Auteur's suicide cast into serious doubt -- there was little question in
A.B.D.-Dr. Notkin's mind that the entire perfect-entertainment-as-Lzez>esíoíí myth surrounding the purportedly lethal final
cartridge was nothing more than a classic illustration of the antinomically schizoid function of the post-industrial capitalist
mechanism, whose logic presented commodity as the escape-from-anxieties-of-mortality-which-escape-is-itself-psychologically-
fatal, as detailed in perspicuous detail in M. Gilles Deleuze's posthumous Incest and the Life of Death in Capitalist Entertainment,
which she'd be happy to lend the figures standing up somewhere above the lamp's white fire, one of them tapping something
irritatingly against the lamp's conic metal shade, if they'd promise to return it and not mark it up.
      -- That -- in response to respectful but pointed requests to keep the responses on some sort of factual track and spare them
all the eggheaded abstractions -- Madame Psychosis's deforming trauma, in its combination of coincidence and malefic intention,
had been like something right out of the Auteur's most ghastly and unresolvable proto-incestuous disaster films, e.g. The Night
Wears a Sombrero, Dial C for Concupiscence, and The Unfortunate Case of Me. That Madame Psychosis, an only child, had been
extremely and heart-warmingly close to her father, a low-pH chemist for a Kentucky reagent outfit, who'd apparently had an
extremely close only-child and watching-movies-together-based relationship with his own mother and seemed to reenact the
closeness with Madame Psychosis, taking her to movies on a near-daily basis, in Kentucky, and driving her all over the mid-South
for various junior baton-twirling competitions while his wife, Madame Psychosis's mother, a devoutly religious but wounded and
neurasthenic woman with a fear of public spaces, stayed home on the family farm, canning preserves and seeing to the
administration of the farm, etc. But that things had gotten first strange and then creepy as Madame Psychosis entered puberty,
apparently; specifically the low-pH father had gotten creepy, seeming to behave as if Madame Psychosis were getting younger
instead of older: taking her to increasingly child-rated films at the local Cineplex, refusing to acknowledge issues of menses or
breasts, strongly discouraging dating, etc. Apparently issues were complicated by the fact that Madame Psychosis emerged from
puberty as an almost freakishly beautiful young woman, especially in a part of the United States where poor nutrition and
indifference to dentition and hygiene made physical beauty an extremely rare and sort of discomfiting condition, one in no way
shared by Madame Psychosis's toothless and fireplug-shaped mother, who said not a word as Madame Psychosis's father
interdicted everything from brassieres to Pap smears, addressing the nubile Madame Psychosis in progressively puerile baby-talk
and continuing to use her childhood diminutive like Pookie or Putti as he attempted to dissuade her from accepting a scholarship
to a Boston University whose Film and Film-Cartridge Studies Program was, he apparently maintained, full of quote Nasty
Pootem Wooky Barn-Bams, unquote, whatever family-code pejorative this signified.
     -- That -- to cut to a chase which the interviewers' hands-on-hip attitudes and replacement of the lamp's bulb with a much
higher wattage signified they'd very much like to see cut to -- as is often the case, it wasn't until Madame Psychosis got to college
and gradually acquired some psychic distance and matter for emotional comparison that she even began to see how creepy her
reagent-Daddy's regression had been, and not until a certain major-sport-star son's autograph on a punctured football inspired
more e-mailed suspicion and sarcasm than gratitude from home in KY that she began even to suspect that her lack of social life
throughout puberty might have had as much to do with her Daddy's intrusive discouragement as with her actaeonizing pubescent
charms. That -- pausing briefly to spell actaeonizing -- the shit had hit the intergenerational psychic fan when Madame Psychosis
brought the Auteur's little rotter of a son home to the KY spread for the third time, for Thanksgiving in the Year of the Tucks
Medicated Pad, and witnessing her Daddy's infantilizing conduct of her and her mother's wordless compulsive canning and
cooking, not to mention the terrific tension that resulted when Madame Psychosis attempted to move some of the stuffed animals
out of her room to make room for the Auteur's son, in short experiencing her home and Daddy through the comparative filter of
enmeshment with the Auteur's son brought Madame Psychosis to the crisis that precipitates Speaking the Unspeakable; and that it
had been at Thanksgiving Dinner, at midday on 24 November Y.T.M.P., when the low-pH Daddy began not only cutting up
Madame Psychosis's plate's turkey for her but mashing it into puree between the tines of his fork, all under the raised comparative
eyebrows of the Auteur's son, that Madame Psychosis finally aired the unspoken question of why, with her now of legal age and
living with a male and retired from childhood's twirling and carving out an adult career on one and potentially two sides of the
film-camera, did her own personal Daddy seem to feel she needed help to chew? Molly Notkin's secondhand take on the
emotional eruptions that ensued is not detailed, but she feels she can state w/ confidence that it's plausibly a case of any kind of
system that's been under enormous silent pressure for some time, that when the system finally blows the accreted pressure's such
that it's almost always a full-scale eruption. The low-pH Daddy's enormous stress had apparently erupted, right there at the table,
with his grown daughter's white meat between his tines, in the confession that he'd been secretly, silently in love with Madame
Psychosis from way, way back; that the love had been the real thing, pure, unspoken, genuflectory, timeless, impossible; that he
never touched her, wouldn't, nor ogle, less out of a horror of being the sort of mid-South father who touched and ogled than out of
the purity of his doomed love for the little girl he'd escorted to the movies as proudly as any beau, daily; that the repression and
disguisability of his pure love hadn't been all that hard when Madame Psychosis had been juvenile and sexless, but that at the
onset of puberty and nubility the pressure'd become so great that he could compensate only by regressing the child mentally to an
age of incontinence and pre-mashed meat, and that his awareness of how creepy his denial of her maturation must have seemed --
even though neither the daughter nor mother, even now wordlessly chewing a candied yam, had remarked on it, the denial and
creepiness, although the man's beloved pointers were given to whimper and scratch at the door when the denial had gotten
especially creepy (animals being way more sensitive than humans to emotional anomalies, in Molly Notkin's experience) -- had
raised his internal limbic system's pressure to near intolerable foot-kilo levels, and that he'd been hanging on for dear life for the
past nigh on now a decade, but that now that he'd had to actually stand witness to the removal of Pooky and Urgle-Bear et al. from
her ballerina-wallpapered room to make space for a nonrelated mature male whose physical vigor through the peephole the
Daddy'd exerted every gram of trembling will he'd possessed trying not to drill the hole in the bathroom wall just above the mirror
over the sink whose pipes made the wall behind the headboard of Madame Psychosis's room's bed sing and clunk, and through
which, late at night -- claiming to Mother a case of skitters from all the holiday nibbles -- hunched atop the sink, every night
since Madame Psychosis and the Auteur's son had first arrived to sleep together in the unstuffed-animaled bed of a childhood
through which he'd been all but tortured by the purity of his impossible love for the --
     -- That it had been at this point that Madame Psychosis's mother's fork and then whole plate had clattered to the floor, and
that amid the sounds of the pointers under the table fighting over that plate the mother's own denial-system's pressure blew, and
she freaked, announcing publicly at the table that she and the Daddy had not once known each other as man and wife since
Madame Psychosis had first menstruated, that she'd known something incredibly creepy was going on but had denied it, evacuated
her suspicions and placed them under great pressure in the bell-jar of her own denial, because, she admits -- admits is probably
less accurate than something like keens or shrieks or jabbers -- that her own father -- an itinerant camp-meeting preacher -- had
molested her and her sister all through childhood, ogled and touched and worse, and that this had been why she'd married at just
sixteen, to escape, and that now it was clear to her that she'd married the exact same kind of monster, the kind who spurns his
ordained mate and wants his daughter.
     -- That she'd said maybe it was her, she, the mother, who was the monster, which if so she was tired of hiding it and
appearing falsely before God and man.
     -- That whereupon she'd reeled from her place and hurdled three pointers and run down to the Daddy's acid-lab in the cellar,
to disfigure herself with acid.
     -- That the Daddy'd kept a world-class collection of various acids in Pyrex-brand flasks on wooden shelves down in the
cellar.
     -- That the Daddy, the rotter of a son, and finally a shock-slowed Madame Psychosis had all run down the stairs after the
mother and hit the cellar just as the mother had removed the stopper of a Pyrex flask with an enormous half-eaten-away skull on
the side, which along with the flaming scarlet piece of litmus paper afloat inside signified an incredibly low-pH and corrosive type
of acid.
     -- That Madame Psychosis's name was in reality Lucille Duquette, and the Daddy's name either Earl or Al Duquette of
extreme southeast KY, way down near TN and VA.
     -- That, despite the little rotter's professions of self-recrimination for allowing the deformity to take place and claim that the
swirling systems of guilt and horror and denial-informed forgiveness made a committed relationship with Madame Psychosis
increasingly untenable, it didn't take an expert in character-disorders and weaknesses to figure out why the fellow'd given Madame
Psychosis the boot within months of the traumatic deformity, now did it.
     -- That, right on the hysterical cusp where internalized rage can so easily shift to externalized rage, the mother had hurled the
low-pH flask at the Daddy, who'd reflexively ducked; and that the rotter, one Orin, right behind, a former tennis champion with
superb upper-body reflexes, had instinctively ducked also, leaving Madame Psychosis -- dazed and bradykinetic from the
sudden venting of so many high-pressure repressive family systems -- open for a direct facial hit, resulting in the traumatic de-
formity. And that it had been everyone's failure to press any charges that had liberated the mother from Southeast-KY custody and
allowed her access once again to her home's kitchen, where, apparently despondent, she committed suicide by putting her
extremities down the garbage disposal -- first one arm and then, kind of miraculously if you think about it, the other arm.
