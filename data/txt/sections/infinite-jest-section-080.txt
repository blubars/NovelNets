     30 APRIL / 1 MAY YEAR OF THE DEPEND ADULT UNDERGARMENT
     The choreography of interface had settled into the form of Steeply smoking, his bare arms crossed, going up and down slowly
on the toes of his high heels, while Marathe hunched slightly in his metal chair, shoulders rounded and head slightly forward in a
practiced position that allowed him almost to sleep while still attending to every detail of a conversation or wearisome
surveillance. He (Marathe) had drawn his plaid blanket up to his chest. It was increasingly chilly at the altitude of the shelf. They
could feel the remains of the U.S.A. Sonora Desert's heat rising past them into the clotted spangle of stars that were above them.
The shirt Marathe wore beneath his windbreaker was not of Hawaiian type.
     Marathe remained unsure in this time of what exactly it was that Hugh Steeply of U.S.O.U.S. wished to learn from him, or
verify, through Mar-athe's betrayal. Near midnight Steeply had given him the datum that he (Steeply) had been on the personal
Marital Leave over his recent divorce, and was now back in the field of duty, wearing prosthetic breasts and woman-journalist
credentials, assigned to cultivate some of the Entertainment's alleged filmmaker's relatives and inner circles. Marathe had made
gentle fun of the inoriginality of a journalistic cover, then later less gentle fun of Steeply's cover's false name, expressing humored
doubts that the meaty electrolysized face of Steeply would be responsible of launching even one ship or vessel.
