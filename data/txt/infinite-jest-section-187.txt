      She wasn't dumb -- she figured it was likely that they'd let her loose just to see where she'd go.
      She went home. She went to the House. She got one of the last trains before they closed the T, probably. It took forever to get
from Comm. Ave. down to Enfield Marine in her clogs and skirt in the snow, and melt soaked the veil and made it adhere to the
features below. She'd been close to removing the veil to get away from the outside-linebacker of a federal lady anyway. She
looked now just like a linen-pale version of what she really looked like. But there was no one about in the snow. She figured if she
could speak with Pat M. Pat M. might be prevailed upon to put her in quarantine with Clenette and Yolanda, not let in no law. She
could tell Pat about the wheelchairs, try to convince her to dismantle the ramp. The visibility was so bad she didn't see it til she
cleared the Shed, the Middlesex County Sheriff's car, fiercely snow-tired, lights going bluely, parked idling in the roadlet outside
the ramp, wipers on Occasional, a uniform at the wheel absently feeling his face.
