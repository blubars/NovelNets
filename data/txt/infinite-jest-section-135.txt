      Geoffrey Day's noted the way most of the male residents of Ennet House have special little cognomens for their genitals. E.g.
'Bruno,' 'Jake,' 'Fang' (Minty), 'The One-Eyed Monk,' 'Fritzie,' 'Russell the Love Muscle.' He speculates this could be a class thing:
neither he nor Ewell nor Ken Erdedy have named their Units. Like Ewell, Day enters a certain amount of comparative-class data
in his journal. Doony Glynn called his penis 'Poor Richard'; Chandler Foss confessed to the moniker 'Barn-Bam.' Lenz had
referred to his own Unit as 'the Frightful Hog.' Day would die before admitting he missed either Lenz or his soliloquies about the
Hog, which had been frequent. The penis in question had been that curious two or three shades darker than the rest of Lenz that
people's penises sometimes are. Lenz had brandished it at his roommates whenever he wished to emphasize a point. It had been
short and thick and blunt, and Lenz described the Hog as a pr√≠mo example of what he called the Polish Curse, viz. undistinguished
length but sobering circumference: 'Easy on the bottom but tears hell out of the sides, brother.' This had been his description of the
Polish Curse. A surprising amount of Day's Recovery Journal is filled with quotations from R. Lenz. Lenz's discharge had moved
the tax-attorney Tiny Ewell up into the 3-Man room with Day. Ewell was the one man here with whom a conversation of anything
remotely approaching depth could be held, so Day was nonplussed when he found himself, after a couple long nights, almost
missing Lenz, his obsession with time, his patter, his way of leaning up against the wall upside-down in his briefs, or brandishing
the Hog.
