     It was strange upon strange; it was almost as if the legless and pathologically shy punting-groupies were somehow afraid of
Moment's Junoesque Ms. Steeply -- Orin had seen his last wheelchair the day before she came up, and now (he realized, driving)
it was only hours after she'd left that they were now back, with their shy ruses. The Excitement-Hope-Acquisition-Contempt cycle
of seduction always left Orin stunned and wrung out and not at his quickest on the uptake. It was only after he'd cleaned up and
dressed and exchanged the standard compliments and assurances, taken the elevator's glass pod down the tall hotel's round glass
core into the lobby, gone out through the pressurized revolving door into the scalp-crackling gust of Phoenix heat, waited for the
car's directional AC to render the steering wheel touchable, and then injected himself into the teeming arteries of Rt. 85 and Bell
Rd. west, back out toward Sun City, ruminating as he drove, that it kertwanged on him that the handicapped man at the hotel
room's door had had a wheelchair, that it was the first wheelchair he'd seen since Hal'd hit him with his theory, and that the legless
surveyer had had (stranger) the same Swiss accent as the hand-model.
