     At lunchtime, Hal Incandenza was lying on his bunk in bright sunlight through the window with his hands laced over his
chest, and Jim Troeltsch poked his head in and asked Hal what he was doing, and Hal told him photosynthesizing and then didn't
say anything else until Troeltsch went away.
     Then, 41 breaths later, Michael Pemulis stuck his head in where Troeltsch's had been.
     'Did you eat yet?'
     Hal made his stomach bulge up and patted it, still looking at the ceiling. 'The beast has killed and gorged and now lies in the
shade of the Baobob tree.'
     'Gotcha.'
     'Surveying his loyal pride.'
     'I gotcha.'
     Over 200 breaths later, John ('N.R.') Wayne opened up the ajar door a little more and put his whole head in and stayed like
that, with just his head in. He didn't say anything and Hal didn't say anything, and they stayed like that for a while, and then
Wayne's head smoothly withdrew.
