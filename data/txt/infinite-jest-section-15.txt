     Eighteen in May, Mario Incandenza's designated function around Enfield Tennis Academy is filmic: sometimes during A.M.
drills or P.M. matches he'll be assigned by Coach Schtitt et al. to set up an old camcorder or whatever video stuff's to hand on a
tripod and record a certain area of court, videotaping different kids' strokes, footwork, certain tics and hitches in serves or running
volleys, so the staff can show the tapes to the kids instructionally, letting the kids see on the screen exactly what a coach or
prorector's talking about. The reason being it's a lot easier to fix something if you can see it.
