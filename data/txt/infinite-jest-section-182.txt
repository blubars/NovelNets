     'Oh for Christ's sake then.
     'I was in two scenes. What else is in there I do not know. In the first scene I'm going through a revolving door. You know,
around in this glass revolving door, and going around out as I go in is somebody I know but apparently haven't seen for a long
time, because the recognition calls for a shocked look, and the person sees me and gives an equally shocked look -- we're
supposedly formerly very close and now haven't seen each other in the longest time, and the meeting is random chance. And
instead of going in I keep going around in the door to follow the person out, which person is also still revolving in the door to
follow me in, and we whirl in the door like that for several whirls.'
     'Q.'
     'The actor was male. He wasn't one of Jim's regulars. But the character I recognize in the door is epicene.'
     'Q.'
     'Hermaphroditic. Androgynous. It wasn't obvious that the character was supposed to be a male character. I assume you can
Identify.
     'The other had the camera bolted down inside a stroller or bassinet. I wore an incredible white floor-length gown of some sort
of flowing material and leaned in over the camera in the crib and simply apologized.'
     'Q.'
     'Apologized. As in my lines were various apologies. "I'm so sorry. I'm so terribly sorry. I am so, so sorry. Please know how
very, very, very sorry I am." For a real long time. I doubt he used it all, I strongly doubt he used it all, but there were at least
twenty minutes of permutations of "I'm sorry."
     'Q.'
     'Not exactly. Not exactly veiled.'
     'Q.'
     'The point of view was from the crib, yes. A crib's-eye view. But that's not what I mean by driving the scene. The camera was
fitted with a lens with something Jim called I think an auto-wobble. Ocular wobble, something like that. A ball-and-socket joint
behind the mount that made the lens wobble a little bit. It made a weird little tiny whirring noise, I recollect.'
     'Q.'
     'The mount's the barrel. The mount's what the elements of the lens are arranged in. This crib-lens's mount projected out way
farther than a conventional lens, but it wasn't near as big around as a catadioptric lens. It looked more like an eye-stalk or a night-
vision scope than a lens. Long and skinny and projecting, with this slight wobble. I don't know much about lenses beyond basic
concepts like length and speed. Lenses were Jim's forte. This can't be much of a surprise. He always had a whole case full. He paid
more attention to the lenses and lights than to the camera. His other son carried them in a special case. Leith was cameras, the son
was lenses. Lenses Jim said were what he had to bring to the whole enterprise. Of filmmaking. Of himself. He made all his own.'
     'Q.'
     'Well I've never been around them. But I know there's something wobbled and weird about their vision, supposedly. I think
the newer-born they are, the more the wobble. Plus I think a milky blur. Neonatal nystagmus. I don't know where I heard that
term. I don't remember. It could have been Jim. It could have been the son. What I know about infants personally you couJd -- it
may have been an astigmatic lens. I don't think there's much doubt the lens was supposed to reproduce an infantile visual field.
That's what you could feel was driving the scene. My face wasn't important. You never got the sense it was meant to be captured
realistically by this lens.'
     Â·Q.'
     'I never saw it. I've got no idea.'
     'Q.'
     'They were buried with him. The Masters of everything unreleased. At least that was in his will.'
     'Q.'
     'It had nothing to do with killing himself. Less than nothing to do with it.'
     'Q.'
     'No I never saw his fucking will. He told me. He told me things.
     'He'd stopped being drunk all the time. That killed him. He couldn't take it but he'd made a promise.'
     'Q.'
     'I don't know that he ever even got a finished Master. That's your story. There wasn't anything unendurable or enslaving in
either of my scenes. Nothing like these actual-perfection rumors. These are academic rumors. He talked about making something
quote too perfect. But as a joke. He had a thing about entertainment, being criticized about entertainment v. nonen-tertainment and
stasis. He used to refer to the Work itself as "entertainments." He always meant it ironically. Even in jokes he never talked about
an anti-version or antidote for God's sake. He'd never carry it that far. A joke.'
     '...'
     'When he talked about this thing as a quote perfect entertainment, terminally compelling -- it was always ironic -- he was
having a sly little jab at me. I used to go around saying the veil was to disguise lethal perfection, that I was too lethally beautiful
for people to stand. It was a kind of joke I'd gotten from one of his entertainments, the Medusa-Odalisk thing. That even in
U.H.I.D. I hid by hiddenness, in denial about the deformity itself. So Jim took a failed piece and told me it was too perfect to
release -- it'd paralyze people. It was entirely clear that it was an ironic joke. To me.'
     'Q.'
     'Jim's humor was a dry humor.'
     'Q.'
     'If it got made and nobody's seen it, the Master, it's in there with him. Buried. That's just a guess. But I bet you.'
     '...'
     'Call it an educated bet.' 'Q.'
     '...'
     'Q, Q, Q.'
     'That's the part of the joke he didn't know. Where he's buried is itself buried, now. It's in your annulation-zone. It's not even
your territory. And now if you want the thing -- he'd enjoy the joke very much, I think. Oh shit yes very much.'
