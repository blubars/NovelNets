     Chief Steve McGarrett of 'Hawaii Five-0' and Captain Frank Furillo of 'Hill Street Blues' are useful for seeing how our North
American idea of the hero changed from the B.S. 1970s era of 'Hawaii Five-0' to the B.S. 1980s era of 'Hill Street Blues.'
     Chief Steve McGarrett is a classically modern hero of action. He acts out. It is what he does. The camera is always on him.
He is hardly ever offscreen. He has just one case per week. The audience knows what the case is and also knows, by the end of
Act One, who is guilty. Because the audience knows the truth before Steve McGarrett does, there is no mystery, there is only
Steve McGarrett. The drama of 'Hawaii Five-0' is watching the hero in action, watching Steve McGarrett stalk and strut, homing
in on the truth. Homing in is the essence of what the classic hero of modern action does.
     Steve McGarrett is not weighed down by administrative State-Políce-Chief chores, or by females, or friends, or emotions, or
any sorts of conflicting demands on his attention. His field of action is bare of diverting clutter. Thus Chief Steve McGarrett
single-mindedly acts to refashion a truth the audience already knows into an object of law, justice, modern heroism.
     In contrast, Captain Frank Furillo is what used to be designated a 'post'-modern hero. Viz., a hero whose virtues are suited to a
more complex and corporate American era. I.e., a hero of reaction. Captain Frank Furillo does not investigate cases or single-
mindedly home in. He commands a precinct. He is a bureaucrat, and his heroism is bureaucratic, with a genius for navigating
cluttered fields. In each broadcast episode of 'Hill Street Blues,' Captain Frank Furillo is beset by petty distractions on all sides
from the very beginning of Act One. Not one but eleven complex cases, each with suspects and snitches and investigating officers
and angry community leaders and victims' families all clamoring for redress. Hundreds of tasks to delegate, egos to massage,
promises to make, promises from last week to keep. Two or three cops' domestic troubles. Payroll vouchers. Duty logs. Corruption
to be tempted by and agonized over. A Police Chief who's a political parody, a hyperactive son, an ex-wife who haunts the
frosted-glass cubicle that serves as Frank Furillo's office (whereas Steve McGarrett's B.S. 1970s office more closely resembled the
libraries of landed gentry, hushed behind two heavy doors and wainscot-ted in thick, tropical oak), plus a coldly attractive Public
Defendress who wants to talk about did this suspect get Mirandized in Spanish and can Frank stop coming too soon he came too
soon again last night maybe he should get into some kind of stress counselling. Plus all the weekly moral dilemmas and double
binds his even-handed bureaucratic heroism gets Captain Frank Furillo into.
     Captain Frank Furillo of 'Hill Street Blues' is a 'post'-modern hero, a virtuoso of triage and compromise and administration.
Frank Furillo retains his sanity, composure, and superior grooming in the face of a barrage of distracting, unheroic demands that
would have left Chief Steve McGarrett slumped, unkempt, and chewing his knuckle in administrative confusion.
     In further contrast to Chief Steve McGarrett, Captain Frank Furillo is rarely filmed tight or full-front. He is usually one part of
a frenetic, moving pan by the program's camera. In contrast, 'Hawaii Five-o' 's camera crew never even used a dolly, favoring a
steady tripodic close-up on McGar-rett's face that today seems more reminiscent of romantic portraiture than filmed drama.
     What kind of hero comes after McGarrett's Irishized modern cowboy, the lone man of action riding lonely herd in paradise?
Furillo's is a whole different kind of loneliness. The 'post'-modern hero was a heroic part of the herd, responsible for all of what he
is part of, responsible to everyone, his lonely face as placid under pressure as a cow's face. The jut-jawed hero of action ('Hawaii
Five-0') becomes the mild-eyed hero of reaction ('Hill Street Blues,' a decade later).
     And, as we have observed thus far in our class, we, as a North American audience, have favored the more Stoic, corporate
hero of reactive probity ever since, some might be led to argue 'trapped' in the reactive moral ambiguity of 'post-' and 'post-post'-
modern culture.
     But what comes next? What North American hero can hope to succeed the placid Frank? We await, I predict, the hero of «o«-
action, the catatonic hero, the one beyond calm, divorced from all stimulus, carried here and there across sets by burly extras
whose blood sings with retrograde amines.
