      The organopsychedelic muscimole, an isoxazole-alkaloid derived from Amanita muscaria, a.k.a. the fly agaric mushroom --
by no means, Michael Pemulis emphasizes, to be confused with phalloides or verna or certain other kill-you-dead species of North
America's Amanita genus, as the little kids sit there Indian-style on the Viewing Room floor, glassy-eyed and trying not to yawn
-- goes by the structural moniker 5-aminomethyl-3-isoxazolol, requires about like maybe ten to twenty oral mg. per ingestion,
making it two to three times as potent as psilocybin, and frequently results in the following alterations in consciousness (not
reading or referring to notes in any way): a kind of semi-sleep-like trance with visions, elation, sensations of physical lightness
and increased strength, heightened sensual perceptions, synesthesia, and favorable distortions in body-image. This is supposed to
be a pre-dinner 'Big Buddy' powwow, where the littler kids receive general big-brotherly-type support and counsel from an
upperclass-man. Pemulis sometimes treats his group's powwows like a kind of colloquium, sharing personal findings and interests.
The viewer's on Read from the room's laptop, and the screen's got block-capitaled METHOXYLATED BASES FOR
PHENYLKYLAMINE MANIPULATION on it, and underneath some stuff that might as well be Greek to the Little Buds. Two of
the kids squeeze tennis balls; two rock and bob Hasidically to stay alert; one has a hat with a pair of fake antennae made of tight-
coiled spring. More or less revered by the aboriginal tribes of what's now southern Quebec and the Great Concavity, Pemulis tells
them, the fly agaric 'shroom was both loved and hated for its powerful but not always unless carefully titrated pleasant psycho-
spiritual effects. A boy probes at his own navel with great interest. Another pretends to fall over.
