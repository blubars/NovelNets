\section{Static-Network Analysis}

\subsection{Statistics}

\subsubsection{Degree Distribution}
Average Degree

Power law? 
$$P(k) \sim k^{-\tau}$$
$$P(k) \sim k^{-\tau}10^{-k/c}$$

TODO: 'logarithmically bin data and perform a linear regression of Log(P(5)) on log(r) to get the power law fit

\subsubsection{Assortativity}

\subsubsection{Small World}
Comparison of diameter to real social networks?

\subsection{Modularity}

- talk about NMI
- talk about modularity

\subsubsection{Clustering}
 - compare against config model expectations?

 look at triangles, how many are closed/open, compare to expectations from a normal social network?

\subsection{Gender}
