\section{\infinitejest as a Network}

There are many possible definitions of an edge in a social network: dialogue, physical interactions, sentiment. 
We chose to present character co-mentions in the text as edges. 
This gives us the broadest view of a book as a network of character interactions, and additionally eases the burden of natural-language parsing because we can disregard all semantic information in the interactions.
