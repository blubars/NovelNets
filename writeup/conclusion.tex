\section{Conclusion}

\section{Future Work}

Given more time and resources, there are several interesting questions to explore. We only ran our analysis with a single book, but it would be interesting to compare character interaction networks within and between different genres. For example, given a few dozen books, we could start to determine how \infinitejest's character network structure compare to other postmodern works, or how postmodern works differ from others like mysteries, historical fiction, fantasy, or short stories.

It would also be interesting to note if we can structurally identify common narrative techniques or plot devices -- for example, the climax, backstories, cliffhangers, plot twists, or stories-within-stories.
