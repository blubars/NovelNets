It is a precursor used in the synthesis of some polymers but is most emphatically not pimple cream as DFW claims.  I suspect it would burn your skin off."  Although, Olympia continues, "I also realized that it could just be a printer's or editor's error: the formula would be correct for benzoyl peroxide if it were (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>CO)<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> instead of (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>CO)<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.
