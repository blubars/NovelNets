I suspect it would burn your skin off.\"  Although, Olympia continues, \"I also realized that it could just be a printer's or editor's error: the formula would be correct for benzoyl peroxide if it were (C6H5CO)2O2 instead of (C2H5CO)2O2.  The substitution of C2H5 for C6H5 (ethyl for benzyl) would be a natural error for someone who knew a little bit of chemistry but who wasn't thinking about aromatic rings.\""
